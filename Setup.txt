There are some files that need to exist in this directory for the project to work that were not included on git for
security reasons.

For database credentials, there needs to be a file in this directory called mydbcredentials.txt that has two lines.
The first line is the user name and the second line is the password.

Properly use selenium, there needs to be a file called webdriverpath.txt with one line that is the absolute filepath of
the firefox geckodriver.
