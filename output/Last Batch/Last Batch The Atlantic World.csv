Former President Donald Trump gave a long and deranged speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference this weekend. We need to stop treating support for Trump as if it’s just another political choice and instead work to isolate his renewed threat to our democracy and our national security.
But first, here are three new stories from The Atlantic.

1,2023-03-06 20:09:05.525845,2023-03-06 19:20:00,15 Readers on Their Religious Journeys,"This is an edition of Up for Debate, a newsletter by Conor Friedersdorf. On Wednesdays, he rounds up timely conversations and solicits reader responses to one thought-provoking question. Later, he publishes some thoughtful replies. Sign up for the newsletter here.
I recently asked readers to describe their relationship with organized religion. What follows is a continuation of the outpouring of responses I received.
Betsy explains why she rejects hierarchical religious organizations:

Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, and [religion] is no exception. There are many fine and "
2,2023-03-06 20:09:05.525845,2023-03-06 19:20:00,The Fury of Chris Rock,"If the Academy Awards were pretaped, the public would never have seen Will Smith slap Chris Rock last year. Sure, the incident would be known about and reported on, but the bizarre, disquieting electricity of that moment came from it happening live, on a worldwide broadcast, during a meticulously choreographed event. Ever since then, the question has been how Rock would officially respond. Would he drop by a talk show and throw some barbs Smith’s way? Would he take the high road and ignore it? No, Rock is a stand-up comedian by trade, practiced in the realm of unplanned moments, so the most na "
3,2023-03-06 20:09:05.525845,2023-03-06 19:20:00,How to Take Back Control of What You Read on the Internet,"The social-media web is built on a lie. Platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter enticed countless users to join with the promise that they could see everything their friends or favorite celebrities posted in one convenient location.
Over time, though, the sites were carefully calibrated to filter what users saw—regardless of their stated preferences—in order to manipulate their attention and keep them on the platform. Algorithmic timelines quietly replaced chronological ones, until our social-media feeds no longer took direction from us, but rather directed us where they wanted us t "
4,2023-03-06 20:09:05.525845,2023-03-06 19:20:00,Trump Has Become the Thing He Never Wanted to Be,"One thing can be said for the proprietors of the MAGA Mall: They know their brand.
The right-wing-merch retailer’s setup was among the most impressive at this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference—a gargantuan display of apparel and tchotchkes meticulously curated to appeal to every segment of the Donald Trump–loving clientele. There were the MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN hats in “classic” red for those who prefer a timeless look, and the ULTRA MAGA 45 hats for the more trend-conscious. There were T-shirts with Trump as Superman and T-shirts with Trump as the Terminator and—because even t "
5,2023-03-06 20:09:05.525845,2023-03-06 19:20:00,Special Ed Shouldn’t Be Separate,"In the fall of 2020, as my son and his neighborhood friends started to trickle back out into the world, my daughter, Izzy, stayed home. At the time, Izzy was 3 years old, ripe for the natural learning that comes from being with other kids. I knew by the way she hummed and flapped her hands around children at the playground—and by her frustration with me at home—that she yearned to be among them.
The question of where Izzy would attend school had been vexing me for two years. Izzy had been a happy infant, but she was small for her age and missed every developmental milestone. When she was eight "
6,2023-03-06 12:09:04.517161,2023-03-06 11:00:00,"GPT-4 Might Just Be a Bloated, Pointless Mess","As a rule, hyping something that doesn’t yet exist is a lot easier than hyping something that does. OpenAI’s GPT-4 language model—much anticipated; yet to be released—has been the subject of unchecked, preposterous speculation in recent months. One post that has circulated widely online purports to evince its extraordinary power. An illustration shows a tiny dot representing GPT-3 and its “175 billion parameters.” Next to it is a much, much larger circle representing GPT-4, with 100 trillion parameters. The new model, one evangelist tweeted, “will make ChatGPT look like a toy.” “Buckle up,” tw "
7,2023-03-06 12:09:04.517161,2023-03-06 07:00:00,How to Live With Fear,"In classic fables and fairy tales, no predator—and perhaps no villain—makes more frequent appearances than the wolf. Greek antiquity gives us the Boy Who Cried Wolf, Little Red Riding Hood famously gets eaten by a wolf, and yet another one blows down the Three Little Pigs’ houses. Wolfish, the writer Erica Berry’s debut, looks both at these invented wolves and at the real ones that have, of late, returned to her home state of Oregon; she also examines the more contemporary wolf metaphors—lone-wolf terrorists, warriors as wolves—that many people use to describe, or perhaps justify, their fear o "
8,2023-03-06 12:09:04.517161,2023-03-06 07:00:00,How Not to Conduct a Leak Investigation,"Immediately following the leak of its draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health last spring, the Supreme Court in a press release described the incident as an “egregious” breach of trust. Chief Justice John Roberts directed the marshal of the Supreme Court to investigate the leak. That investigation resulted in a report, issued earlier this year, that did not uncover the source of the leak.
This result did not surprise me. As the inspector general of the Department of Justice and acting inspector general of the Department of Defense for many years, I was often asked to conduct leak inve "

Examples can be drawn from the headlines on almost any day: the January 6 storming of the Capitol. A paramilitary group’s plans to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. A man in body armor trying to breach the FBI’s Cincinnati field office. The attack on Paul Pelosi "
