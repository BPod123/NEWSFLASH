Members of a pod had been ramming and shaking boats in the area for more than three years, and had now sunk four. Many observers believed the orcas were attacking their boats, perhaps taking revenge on fishermen. But both boaters and scientists wondered if the orcas were playing, and the marine biologists who study this group think it may be a fad. “The consensus is that they’re doing this to show off,” the director of science at an ocean-conservation group said. (As fads do, this one may have spread; a yacht had been rammed near "
1,2024-03-11 08:21:06.970144,2024-03-11 07:31:00,A Mystery Novel Needs a Detective,"Two detectives walk into a hospital room. That line isn’t a joke, but they are. The detectives are called Martin and Gannon, and they’ve been sent to investigate the burglary and beating of Toby Hennessy, an up-and-coming gallerist in Dublin. But Toby’s cottoned brain can’t quite make out what they’d like from him, and they don’t inspire much confidence; he wants them and their prying questions gone. To his delight and ours, once they walk out, they’re barely heard from again, leaving Tana French’s The Witch Elm all the better for their absence.
This was French’s first novel outside the Dublin "

The most-discussed ceremonies in the last decade have been marked by jaw-dropping viral moments—none of which had much to do with the movies supposedly being celebrated. The wrong Best Picture was announced. Will Smith slapped Chris Rock, then gave a rambling acceptance speech for the Best Actor award. The first Oscars after the start of COVID-19 gambled on ending with one Best Actor win and ended up with another—someone who was at home, and already in bed. Tonight, with multiple giant box office succes "
3,2024-03-11 08:21:06.970144,2024-03-11 01:00:00,Jonathan Glazer’s Warning at the Oscars,"The Oscars are not built for somber appeals about current events, though the show has tried in the past to balance celebration with seriousness. Sometimes that effort has worked: In 2002, after 9/11, Tom Cruise opened the evening with a vague but elegant speech about needing movie magic “more than ever,” which eased the apparent anxiety in the room. Other times, it couldn’t completely control the proceedings: In 2003, shortly after the Iraq War began, the show tried to dissuade flashy displays of emotion and even scrapped the red carpet. But the notoriously vocal director Michael Moore had oth "

Da’Vine Joy Randolph, who won the Best Supporting Actress trophy tonight for her work in The Holdovers, spoke about her career with such earnest passion that she received no shortage of weepy faces from her competitors: Jodie Foster could be seen welling up, as could America Ferrera.
Randolph thanked her mother, her acting teacher, and even her publicist—a funny role reversal. But as she directed her appreciation toward specific people in her life, her speech also acknowledged the rari "
5,2024-03-11 00:21:05.811349,2024-03-10 17:00:00,Scarlett Johansson’s Pitch-Perfect Impersonation,"When Senator Katie Britt of Alabama gave the Republican response to the State of the Union address last Thursday, she introduced herself to America with a bizarre, dramatic speech. Set in a stark kitchen, and veering between folksy and distressed, it was ripe for parody. Naturally, Saturday Night Live would tackle it. But unexpectedly, it did so with the actor Scarlett Johansson—a much more familiar face to many Americans—who handled Britt’s odd performance brilliantly.
Johansson showed up during yesterday’s cold open wearing a replica of Britt’s green blouse and cross necklace. She spoke with "
6,2024-03-11 00:21:05.811349,2024-03-10 17:00:00,Trump Finds Another Line to Cross,"Former President Donald Trump, perhaps threatened by President Joe Biden’s well-received State of the Union address, mocked his opponent’s lifelong stutter at a rally in Georgia yesterday. “Wasn’t it—didn’t it bring us together?” Trump asked sarcastically. He kept the bit going, slipping into a Biden caricature. “‘I’m gonna bring the country tuh-tuh-tuh-together,’” Trump said, straining and narrowing his mouth for comedic effect.
Trump has made a new habit of this. “‘He’s a threat to d-d-democracy,’” Trump said in his vaudeville Biden character at a January rally in Iowa. That jibe was also a "
7,2024-03-10 16:21:04.472667,2024-03-10 11:00:00,The Polarizing Movie That Paved the Way for Barbie-mania,"Nearly a year before the buzzy movie debuted, paparazzi photos of the costumed stars began leaking from the location shoot. When the premiere rolled around, it was just the first in a months-long series of red-carpet events, for which the cast—and fans—wore clothes inspired by the film. The movie went on to become a global hit and an Oscar favorite whose popularity changed the course of contemporary fashion.
No, I’m not talking about Barbie, whose hyperfeminine, hot-pink aesthetic was so ubiquitous last year that it sparked a new Dictionary.com entry. Back in 1967, the crime drama Bonnie and C "
8,2024-03-10 16:21:04.472667,2024-03-10 11:00:00,What Billy Crystal Knew About Hosting the Oscars,"When I started watching the Oscars as a child in 1998, Billy Crystal’s presence felt as fundamental as the Oscar statue itself. Did I understand the jokes, such as when he sang about Titanic to the Gilligan’s Island theme? No way—but Crystal’s smirking tone and raised brows suggested we were all in on it. His unseriousness not only cut through the competitive tension of the night, but also acted as a kind of safety tether for his fellow movie actors: No matter how rude he got, Crystal was roasting Hollywood from the inside. He knew, better than many hosts since, that entertaining the audience "
9,2024-03-10 08:20:53.333097,2024-03-10 00:00:00,When Local Government Bullies the Press,"Until a few months ago, the tiny town of Atmore, Alabama, was perhaps best known for the glitzy casino-and-hotel complex on its northern border and its proximity to the prison where the state carries out executions. Then Stephen Billy decided to pick a fight with the hometown newspaper, the Atmore News. In October, the paper published a story, based on an anonymous leak, revealing that Billy, the county’s district attorney, was conducting a grand-jury investigation into possible financial fraud by the local school system. Shortly thereafter, Billy charged the paper’s publisher, 73-year-old She "
