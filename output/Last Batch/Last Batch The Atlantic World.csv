This month has been a messy one for the Biden family.

On Monday, he sued the Internal Revenue Service, accusing the agency of violating his privacy by disclosing detail "

Sign up for the newsletter here.
Last week, I asked readers, “Do you trust America’s institutions more than, less than, or as much as you did a decade ago? Why?”
Replies have been edited for length and clarity.
Judith sees distrust as a sign of cultural maturity:

I believe that the widespread loss of trust in institutions is a combination of two equally strong forces. The first is our culture’s matu "

Watch any ad for the car, and you’ll surely see it surmounting boulders and conquering muck in places far from the beaten freeway. Electric-vehicle chargers may be scarce in the wilderness, but even a military-derived four-by-four must keep with the times. To the delight of Earth-loving off-roaders, Jeep has announced that the first all-electric Wrangler is in the works. The icons of combustion are going electric, if they haven’t already. Over the next few years, a battery-powered Chevy Silverado, GMC Sierra, and Ram 1500 "

In the morning, McCarthy was forced to scrap a procedural vote on a GOP proposal to avert a government shutdown that will commence at the end of this month if Congress doesn’t act. In the afternoon, a handful of conservatives tanked McCarthy’s bid to advance legislation funding the Pentagon.
The failure of the proposal to prevent a shutdown was the more ominous defeat, both for Republicans and for the country. Yet even if McCarthy manages to pass a version of this, it will almost certainl "

The adult subjects were given a survey about their expectations for their children, and how they typically respond to their needs; the children were tested to determine their attachment style, sociability, and problem-solving skills. I should probably mention that the children involved were dogs.
The dogs who were cared for by owners with an “authoritative” style, meaning one where high expectations matched a high responsiveness "

The citizen, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, had been gunned down outside the Sikh temple where he served as president. Trudeau declared the killing “an unacceptable violation of our sovereignty” and “contrary to the fundamental rules by which free, open, and democratic societies conduct themselves.”
The prime minister’s claim made headlines around the planet, but it sho "

Apart from brief trips to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C., the reclusive Dickinson did not stray far from her comfortable two-story residence in Amherst, Massachusetts, where she wrote nearly 2,000 poems. Only a handful were published in her lifetime, and all anonymously. The house, known as the Dickinson Homestead, and its contents—every sherry glass, quilt, and doll’s slipper—were the locus of her imagination. For Dickinson, the domestic and the literary form one seamless line. Last week "

Donald Hall wasn’t supposed to outlive Jane Kenyon, his wife and fellow poet. He was 19 years her senior, and in 1989, he was diagnosed with colon cancer that subsequently metastasized to his liver. Doctors told him he had a one in three chance of living more than five years. But Hall lived for roughly three more decades; Kenyon died of leukemia in 1995, when she was 47. Hall may once have thought his own cancer diagnosis was the major turning point of his life, but it was Kenyon’s death that divided his story between a before and an after.
In the after, much of Hall "

In Alexandria, at about the same time, a slab of igneous rock etched with Greek and hieroglyphics was packed onto a 40-gun ship and made to brave the waves of the Mediterranean. Later, a colossal pair of winged lions floated on rafts down the Tigris to Baghdad and eventually sailed out of the Persian Gulf, around Africa’s cape, and into the Atlantic "
