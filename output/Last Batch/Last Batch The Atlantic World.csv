Welcome back to The Daily’s Sunday culture edition, in which one Atlantic writer reveals what’s keeping them entertained.
Today’s special guest is Ellen Cushing, The Atlantic’s projects editor. Ellen has written about how Slack upended the workplace and why Amazon Prime Day is dystopian. She’s currently looking forward to the return of The Amazing Race, angling to beat level 5,593 of Candy Crush, an "
1,2023-08-20 11:23:49.751704,2023-08-20 09:00:00,Trump Is Beatable in Iowa,"The recent history of the Iowa Republican caucus offers the candidates chasing former President Donald Trump one big reason for optimism. But that history also presents them with an even larger reason for concern.
In each of the past three contested GOP nomination fights, Iowa Republicans have rejected the candidate considered the national front-runner in the race, as Trump is now. Instead, in each of those three past caucuses, Iowa Republicans delivered victory to an alternative who relied primarily on support from the state’s powerful bloc of evangelical Christian conservatives. &nbsp "

On her outstretched palm
Is a good place to start.
Her father—your grandfather—kept
It in a secret drawer for a day
Like this—a day
You would have a piece of him
Around your neck.
Your grandfather, in your mother’s words,
Refused to let his daughter
Feed her present with the future.
And on the night that you were born,
He drove all the way from Benin to Abuja.
That night, silence became your mother.
All your life, you’ve seen this woman
Only through your father’s eye.
Here, a story you longed for is telling
Itself. Should you be grateful?
Should you think:

On an early July day, Amber Betts spent the afternoon in the community rose garden in Grandview, Washington. Several weeks earlier, invasive Japanese beetles had emerged in droves everywhere in Grandview, a town in central Washington’s Yakima Valley. The infestation had since quieted, but she still spotted a few insects: A cluster of fingernail-size iridescent green beetles, their coppery wings shining, were devouring a rose.
Unchecked, Japanese beetles’ numbers can skyrocket, and the insects can do extensive damage to plants, Betts, a "
4,2023-08-20 11:23:49.751704,2023-08-20 09:00:00,The Dangerous Myth About Trump’s Indictments,"In the months since Donald Trump’s indictments started piling up, pollsters have noticed something remarkable: The dozens of criminal charges brought against the former president have seemed to boost his standing in the Republican presidential primary. Trump has widened his already commanding lead over his rivals, and in poll after poll, GOP voters have said that the charges make them more—not less—likely to vote for him again.
The dynamic has turned an infamous example of Trumpian bravado—his 2016 claim that “I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose vot "

To produce humanlike answers to questions, systems such as ChatGPT process huge quantities of written material. But few people outside of companies such as Meta and OpenAI know the full extent of the texts these programs have been trained on.
Some training text comes from Wikipedia and other online writing, but high-quality generative AI requires higher-quality input than is usually found on the internet—that is, it requires the kind found in books. In a lawsuit filed in California last month, the write "

Check your local listings or watch full episodes here.
Former President Donald Trump is facing what could be his most consequential legal challenge yet, after having been indicted in Fulton County, Georgia this week for his alleged efforts to overturn the state’s 2020 presidential election results. It’s Trump’s fourth indictment in as many months. As things stand now, reporters will spend much of 2024 running between campaign ral "

It’s an inartfully staged sequence, packed with sophomoric jokes and enough f-bombs to rival a Quentin Tarantino film. On the other hand: Will you look at those sweet, scruffy faces! Those little paws! Sure, their CGI-ed mouths appear a bit strange and the canines do not seem to be making direct eye contact with one another, but they each deserve belly rubs and every single treat ever "

Death from colorectal cancer can be prevented by regular screenings. Controlling high blood pressure could prolong the lives of the nearly 500,000 Americans who die from this disease each year. Vaccinations help prevent tetanus, which could otherwise be lethal.
Clearly, preventive medicine can make a big difference to health.
And yet most people don’t get the preventive care that could save their lives. Indeed, as of 2015, only 8 percent of U.S. adults 35 and older had received all immunizations, cancer screenings, and other high-prio "

This protection, embodied in the amendment’s often-overlooked Section 3, automatically excludes from future of "
