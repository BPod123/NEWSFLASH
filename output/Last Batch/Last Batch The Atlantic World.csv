This protection, embodied in the amendment’s often-overlooked Section 3, automatically excludes from future of "

This was an astonishment to all our relatives and friends. For one thing, we were not the sort of people who “summered.” My father was a working stiff; even in the best of times we made do with city parks, the public pool, the fire escape, the air-cooled movie house. For another thing, these happened to be the worst of times, the years of the Great Depression, when it was a generally accepted fact that anyone’s father could join the jobless at any moment.
But my father didn’t believe this fact applied to him. I "

In the immediate aftermath of the fire, officially the deadliest in modern U.S. history, the decision not to sound these alarms has been one of the more baffling ones. Sirens are supposed to warn people, and shouldn’t more people have been warned by any means necessary? The official in charge of making the call, Herman Andaya, resigned Thursday, citing health reasons. And yet, under pressure, officials have also defended their decision not to sound the island "

Lydia Kiesling’s new novel, Mobility, is about a woman who spends her life trying not to see the harm her work is doing to the Earth. The main character, Bunny Glenn, has fallen almost unwittingly into a career in the oil industry. And, as Amy Weiss-Meyer wrote in her essay this week on the book, Kiesling’s portrait of a compromised Everywoman trying to square herself morally with what she does for a living seems meant to make us readers squirm. What Mobility brought to mind "

They were the unholy spawn of a Gucci loafer and an Adidas sneaker. The design mushed together the noncomplementary traits of both brands: a slender black-leather upper with Gucci’s signature brass horsebit hardware, three white stripes on either side, and an inch-tall wooden heel stamped with a golden Adidas trefoil logo. They were the footwear equivalent of semiformal gym shorts. They looked like the shoes of a meathead leprechaun.

We were inside a place of privilege, but not fully part of it. The institution wasn’t built for us, and we knew it. We weren’t like the wealthy white kids whose alumni parents came to visit their favorite haunts in their favorite old college sweatshirts. But we were, we believed, part of a different future. And someday, we would have the chance to put on those sweatshirts ourselves and visit our own kids as students at our alma mater. We were writing a new chapter in these schools’ long h "

Mississippi has found itself in the humiliating position of being compared disobligingly with the United Kingdom. Just last week, the Financial Times ran a column asking, “Is Britain Really as Poor as Mississippi?”  
Most Mississippians do not spend much time worrying about comparisons with Britain. The same cannot be said about those on the other side of the Atlantic. For Brits—and I am one, though now based in Jackson, Mississippi—the issue of whether they are more or less prosperous than Mississippi has become a thing. Indeed, the Financial Times now calls it “the "

He got a flashlight and went outside. “I saw these big blue eyeballs seven feet off the ground,” he told me. Only once his eyes adjusted did he realize three black stallions were out there, staring right at him.
Simpson had spent time with domestic horses—he had grown up on a ranch, before studying science and working in forest management and logging—but he had not known that wild horses spent their nights avoiding predators "
