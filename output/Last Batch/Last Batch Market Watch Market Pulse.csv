The company posed net income of $39.3 million, or $2.89 a share, for the quarter to April 30, down from $84.8 million, or $5.00 a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales fell to $424.1 million from $506.9 million a year ago. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of $3.05 and sales of $418.0 million. Gross margin fell to 37% of net sales from 41.4% a year ago. The roughly 440 basis point decline was due to the deleverage of store occupancy, higher product costs and higher freight and transportation costs. SG&amp;A costs were 22.5% of net sales compared with 18.1% a year ago. ""Our customers spending habits were affected by lower discretionary income due to the absence of stimulus payments received in the first quarter of last year,"" CEO Mike Longo said in a statement. ""We are pleased to report that the supply chain disruption we experienced at the end of last year has improved and our current inventory position is strong and consistent with our forecast."" Inventories rose by about $94 million in the quarter, much of it arriving late in the period. That helped the company replace high demand products that leave it well placed to meet its sales targets for the year. ""Looking ahead, we remain on track to achieve the Fiscal 2023 guidance we outlined last quarter,"" said Longo. That guidance is for sales to be relatively flat versus fiscal 2022 and for EPS to range from  $9.75 to $10.50, compared with a FactSet consensus of $9.75.

In particular, the 1-year to 2-year forward spread on the 1-month OIS has declined to roughly minus 40 basis points, the most negative levels in 30 years, they said in a note released Thursday morning. The previous low had been minus 25 basis points in late 1994, just as the Fed had hiked the fed-funds rate from around 4.75% to 6% the following year.The chart below shows the history of the 1-month U.S. forward spread, with the black line representing the 1y to 2y forward spread.Source: JPMorganAn inversion at the front end of the curve is often seen as a significant development “because it tends to occur relatively rarely,” the JPMorgan team said.One way to interpret this is that markets are pricing in some risk of a policy mistake by the Fed, or the central bank “over-tightening and at risk of having to cut rates as a result of taking rates to restrictive territory and slowing the economy or even prompting a recession,” the JPM team said. Slowing to negative inflows into global equity funds, along without outflows from real estate ETFs, are among the metrics which suggest “that concerns in markets over the potential for a Fed policy mistake have clearly broadened,” JPMorgan strategists Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, Mika Inkinen, and others wrote.Read: ‘Lots of stagflation in the new home market’: Home builder ETFs are struggling“This year’s market trends, negative in equities and bonds and positive in the dollar and commodities, are at risk of a more sustained reversal,” they said. “This should further hit the performance of momentum traders,” which have been “already suffering over the past two weeks from a reversal in rate and dollar momentum.”JPMorgan’s note comes as financial markets returned to risk-on mode. As of Thursday afternoon, all three major stock indexes were higher, with Dow industrials DJIA up by more than 500 points.

After the data release Thursday morning, traders placed a 60% chance on the fed-funds rate target getting between 2.5% and 2.75% by December, up from 35% a week ago, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The likelihood that policy makers would get to a target between 2.75% and 3% by year-end, from a current level between 0.75% and 1%, dropped to 27% from 51% on May 19.Accompanying the drop in first-quarter GDP was the first decline in corporate profits in five quarters — which analysts saw as a sign that the economic contraction was more real than first thought after being chalked up to a record trade deficit. Investors have been focused on how much the Federal Reserve will need to tighten to bring down inflation running at a four-decade high, while questioning whether they’ll be forced to scale back their efforts due to a possible economic slowdown. Major U.S. stock indexes SPXCOMP were up in morning trading, with Dow industrials DJIA rising more than 400 points amid reduced Fed rate expectations. Meanwhile, most Treasury yields were lower as growth concerns weighed on the bond market, with the 10-year rateBX:TMUBMUSD10Y below 2.75%.Minutes of the central bank’s May 3-4 meeting, released Wednesday, showed that most policy makers felt 50 basis point rate hikes would likely be appropriate at the next couple of meetings. Also, a number of participants suggested price pressures “may no longer be worsening.” The minutes “came and went without much fanfare, and failed to inject much life into afternoon markets” on Wednesday “or the debate around the near-term path of policy,” a team at Deutsche Bank DB said in a note Thursday.“With the minutes not living up to hawkish fears alongside growing concerns about a potential recession, investors continued to dial back the likelihood of more aggressive tightening,” Deutsche Bank research analyst Henry Allen and others wrote Thursday. “We’ve taken out nearly a full 25bp hike by now, which is the biggest reversal in monetary policy expectations this year since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began.”</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

27,2022-05-27 17:00:43.145895,2022-05-26 12:58:30,"Jack in the Box stock dives after profit miss, surprise same-store sales drop","<p>Shares of Jack in the Box Inc.  dove 11.2% toward a 2-year low in premarket trading Thursday, after the fast-food restaurant chain reported a fiscal second-quarter profit miss, a surprise decline in same-store sales and a downbeat full-year earnings outlook, citing continued ""inflationary pressure"" facing the industry. Net income dropped to $7.8 million, or 37 cents a share, from $35.9 million, or $1.58 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share slipped to $1.16 from $1.40 and missed the FactSet consensus of $1.33. Revenue grew 25.3% to $322.3 million, above the FactSet consensus of $273.8 million. But systemwide same-store sales fell 0.8% to miss expectations of 1.4% growth, as a 1.7% rise in company-operated same-store sales was offset by a 1.1% decline in franchise same-store sales, with decreases in traffic only partially offset by increases in average check. Expenses jumped 47.7% to $284.1 million, with food and packaging costs surging 95.8% and payroll and employee benefits costs climbing 92.5%. For fiscal 2022, the company expects adjusted EPS of $5.80 to $6.10, below the FactSet consensus of $6.47. The stock has dropped 18.9% year to date through Wednesday, while the S&amp;P 500  has shed 16.5%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
