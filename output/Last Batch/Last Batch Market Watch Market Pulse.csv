Faraday Future, which last month announced another delay for its planned EV as it seeks to raise money to operate through the end of the year, has not yet set a date for the meeting. The company has alleged that a group of shareholders put out ""a number of inaccurate and misleading statements"" and that the proxy seeks to ""correct the record."" In a separate filing Monday, Faraday Future said that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has notified the EV startup that it will not stand for re-election as the company's independent accounting and, and effective immediately, it is no longer the company's independent registered public accounting firm. PwC's report on Faraday Future's financial statements for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 contained a paragraph related to ""substantial doubt"" about Faraday Future's ability to continue as a going concern. Faraday Future went public through a SPAC deal in July 2021 and earlier this year received a noncompliance notice from the Nasdaq relating to filing delays. The stock fell nearly 7% Monday, and so far this year has lost 73%, which compares with losses of around 15% for the S&amp;P 500 index. . </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  shed about 183 points, or 0.6%, to end near 32,099. The S&amp;P 500 index  shed about 0.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  saw the brunt of the day's losses, ending down 1%, according to FactSet. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow both briefly flipped positive earlier in Monday's session, but failed to hold those gains as losses mounted heading into the closing bell. Investors still were digesting Powell's short, but blunt speech at the annual Jackson Hole economic symposium, which was viewed as trigger of Friday's sharp selloff in equities. The Fed's more hawkish tone also sent the 10-year Treasury yield up by 7.5 basis points to 3.109% on Monday, the highest level since June 28, according to Dow Jones Market Data based on 3 p.m. Eastern yields.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Dow industrials  and the S&amp;P 500  were down by around 0.1% each, while the Nasdaq Composite  was off 0.4%. Equities have been weighed down by Friday's remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who said the central bank remains committed to bringing down inflation despite some ""pain"" to households and businesses. The S&amp;P 500 still had pockets of buying, though, in the areas of utilities and energy. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

4,2022-08-30 00:42:49.824583,2022-08-29 17:43:10,Gold futures settle with a modest loss,"<p>Gold futures settled slightly lower on Monday, pressured by a rise in U.S. Treasury yields, but with some weakness in the U.S. dollar limiting losses for the precious metal. Monthly U.S. jobs data due at the end of the week may provide clues on gold's next direction. A lower U.S. August nonfarm payrolls number of around 125,000 jobs would be bullish for gold prices and bearish for the U.S. dollar index and bond yields, said Chintan Karnani, director of research at Insignia Consultants. That number would suggest that interest-rate hikes are cooling the U.S. economy, paving the way for a 50 basis point rate hike in September and a pause in hikes in November, he said. December gold  fell by a dime to settle at $1,749.70 an ounce after trading as high as $1,757.90 during the session. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The state's Office of Cannabis Management on Thursday started accepting application for the first 150 cannabis retail licenses. Cantor Fitzgerald's Zuanic said multi-state cannabis operators will be required to pay $20 million to help fund a $200 million state fund to help finance the first licensees, which will be made up of people who have been jailed or harmed by the War on Drugs. It's not yet been determined which of the eight license types that medical cannabis incumbents will get, Zuanic said. ""For an established medical registered organization, at this stage it is not clear to what they will be 'grandfathered' (just cultivators), and let others do processing as well as wholesale distribution?"" Zuanic said. Ascend Wellness Holdings Inc.  said earlier this week the New York market is not a priority currently and scrapped its acquisition of MedMen's  and Green Thumb Industries  has sounded ""bearish"" on New York, although it's building a large cultivation facility in the state, Zuanic said.
