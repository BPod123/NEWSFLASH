The British pound  tumbled and yields on British government bonds, or gilts, soared after Treasury chief Kwasi Kwarteng on Sept. 23 unveiled a mini-budget plan that included 45 billion pounds in unfunded tax cuts. The Bank of England this week stepped in to buy gilts in an effort to stabilize the bond market. S&amp;P, in a statement, said it now expects the U.K. government deficit to widen by an average 2.6% of gross domestic product annually through 2025, while net general government debt will continue on an upward trajectory, ""in contrast to our previous expectation of it declining as a percentage of GDP from 2023."" The ratings firm said the U.K. ""continues to face balance-of-payment risks stemming from its persistently large current account deficit, which we forecast will widen to 6% of GDP this year, in part driven by higher costs of energy imports.""</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday, the online broker said it expects to take charges of $90 million to $105 million in the third quarter, up from a previous estimate between $45 million to $60 million, in restructuring charges as a result. In August, the company said it was cutting 23% of its full-time staff, following cuts announced in April, which led it to re-evaluate its real-estate portfolio. Robinhood said it decided to partially or completely close five more offices, with four of those leases on office space that has never been occupied. The closures will not result in further layoffs, the company said.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Professional forecasters, policy makers and traders all keep dismissing the way inflation behaved in the 1970s, according to BofA Securities global economist Ethan Harris. That’s when inflation — fueled by the war in Vietnam of the previous decade — proved to be unrelenting, forcing three different Fed chairmen to push interest rates above 10% until the fever of rampant price gains finally broke in the 1980s.Read:Investors may be in for a rude surprise: History shows inflation can take years to return to normal even when the Fed hikes interest rates above 10%Friday’s data releases only underscored the resiliency of inflation: U.S. stocks finished lower on the day, while posting their third straight quarter of declines, after a hotter-than-expected reading within the personal-consumption expenditures price index for August. The eurozone also reported a record 10% annual inflation rate this month. Meanwhile, economists, policy makers and traders are all factoring in a path for U.S. inflation that falls toward or below 3% in 2023.The ramifications of underestimating inflation’s persistency are huge for financial markets, creating the potential to add further losses on top of the trillions of dollars of destruction in U.S. wealth that’s already occurred in 2022. It was the worst September for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 of the past decade, and financial markets are on track for their worst year in at least a half-century. The ordinarily safe world of global bonds fell into its first bear market in 76 years this month, as traders and investors braced for a period of continued rate hikes by central banks. And the dollar — the undisputed winner of 2022’s extreme volatility — is at 20-year highs, leading to speculation about whether an intervention might be needed.Read:‘True carnage’: Stock-market selloff wipes $13 trillion in market cap off broad U.S. benchmark and 2022 has been the worst year for markets (so far) in at least 50 yearsEconomists, policy makers and investors are operating with “a number of potential biases,” according to Harris at BofA Securities. “The biggest bias has been to ignore the lessons of the 1970s, assume the Phillips curve is essentially dead and dismiss evidence to the contrary,” he said. The Phillips curve is the economic theory that concludes lower unemployment is associated with higher inflation. The U.S. jobless rate has been below 4% for much of this year, putting pressure on wages, even as hopes remain that inflation will ultimately ease. “The result has been a painfully slow capitulation process that culminated in the past month.”Indeed, financial markets ended September’s final trading session on a downbeat note. For the third quarter, Dow industrials DJIA  fell  2,049.92 points, or 6.7%, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX  lost 5.3% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped 4.1%. Meanwhile on Friday, Treasury yields posted their largest multi-quarter gains since the 1980s amid a relentless selloff of government debt. And the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY remained around its highest level since 2002.Inflationary forces unleashed by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have reverberated around the world, and it’s been nearly impossible to quantify the continued impact. In 2022, it is pandemic-era dynamics that are fundamentally driving inflation — including outsize stimulus that created a surge in demand and a “less-engaged workforce” that’s reconsidering when, how and where it’s willing to take jobs, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. The primary difference between the 1970s and 2022 is that food and energy prices were the primary driver of underlying inflation a half-century ago, Colas wrote in a note Friday. Severe global supply disruptions and higher demand are what triggered food inflation starting in 1972 and 1973, he said. Meanwhile, energy inflation came in two waves: The first being the 1973 Saudi oil embargo and the second being the supply disruptions caused by the 1978-1979 Iranian revolution.Right now, labor-market conditions “will be harder for Fed policy to address,” Colas said.The headline annual rate of the consumer-price index has been above 8% for six straight months from March to August, and traders of derivatives-like instruments known as fixings foresee at least one more 8%-plus reading for September. Optimism that inflation would soon ease was buttressed by an unexpected downside surprise in July’s reading, but that faded after August’s worrisome rise in the core rate of inflation that omits food and energy prices.Fed officials remain hopeful, though. On Friday, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said all signs point to lower U.S. inflation in coming months.But inflation has flummoxed even the financial market’s most sophisticated traders, who appear at somewhat of a loss when it comes to where inflation might go after the next three months. They see the annual CPI rate coming in at 8.1% in August, 7.3% in October and 6.5% or lower for November and December — before falling to around 2% by June.The reality, though, is that any estimates beyond the next three months should be read as a message that “we don’t know where inflation is heading,” said Gang Hu, a trader of Treasury inflation-protected securities at New York hedge fund WinShore Capital Partners.Hu says he, too, has been overly optimistic that inflation would show signs of meaningfully easing by now. “We are all used to thinking and modeling linearly, and there’s no model capable of describing what’s happening right now.” </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  tumbled about 495 points Friday, or 1.7%, ending near 28,730 as heavy selling intensified into the closing bell. The S&amp;P 500 index [s:spx] shed 1.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  finished down 1.5%. Losses for the week and month were far worse. The Dow led the major stock indexes lower with a 2.9% weekly skid, to end September down 8.8%. But the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq recorded bigger monthly losses of 9.3% and 10.5%, respectively, according to FactSet data. The Federal Reserve's unwavering stance in September on raising rates until inflation finds a path down to its 2% target has been blamed for the sharp selloff. The task has been complicated by a roaring labor market and soaring home prices, which keep pressure on shelter costs. Home prices have only begun to show signs of a retreat after gaining 45% nationally during the pandemic, which will keep focus on next week's jobs update for August. For the year so far, the Dow fell 21%, the S&amp;P 500 skid 24.8% and the Nasdaq shed 32.4%, which marked their worst first 9-month fall in a year since 2002, according to Dow Jones Market Data.      </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The stake has steadily lost value as Juul drew regulatory scrutiny as its fruity flavors and marketing were blamed for a spike in teenage vaping. The vaping company in early September agreed to pay at least $438.5 million in a settlement with more than 30 states. Altria said exercising the option means it has surrendered the right to convert Juul shares to single vote common stock, ""significantly reducing our voting power."" Juul is now free to sell itself to another tobacco company, while Altria can invest in another vaping company or develop its own products.

The stock was the only one of the Dow Jones Industrial Average  components that was falling in the premarket, as Dow futures  rallied 175 points, or 0.6%. Given that Nike's stock was the eighth lowest-priced Dow stock at $95.33 as of Thursday's close, and the Dow is a price-weighed index, the implied price decline from the big percentage selloff would shave only about 58 points off the Dow's price. In comparison, a similar percentage decline in the Dow's highest-priced stock, UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s  at $503.83, would cut about 311 points off the Dow's price.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
