Monday’s almost 54% likelihood is similar to what was priced in a week ago — when the 2-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y, or the rate most associated with the near-term path of Fed policy, hit a nearly two-year high. Traders saw only a 26% chance of a March rate hike on Dec. 3. Investors’ improved optimism about the outlook was reflected in rising Treasury yields across the board on Monday, with the 10-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD10Y climbing to the highest level in more than a month. Investors sold off Treasurys in early Monday trading amid studies showing the omicron variant to be less severe than other variants, despite rising hospitalizations.Sign up for our Market Watch Newsletters here.“Treasuries are catching up to a tighter Fed reality,” wrote Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors.

Previously, the FDA had only authorized a booster for people aged 16 years and older. ""The booster vaccination increases the level of immunity and improves protection against COVID-19 across all age groups that have been authorized to receive one,"" said BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin. ""In the current situation, it is important to offer all eligible individuals a booster, particularly against the backdrop of the newly-emerging variants such as Omicron."" The FDA also reduced the time between getting the two-dose vaccine regimen and the booster shot to five months from six months. The FDA's EUA comes after ""real world evidence"" of more than 4.1 million booster doses administered given at least 5 months after the primary series of doses showed no new safety concerns in children 12 through 17 years of age. The news didn't help the companies' stocks, however, as shares of Pfizer dropped 3.7% in morning trading and BioNTech slumped 6.6%. Meanwhile, share of Moderna Inc.  sank 8.1% and Johnson & Johnson  slipped 0.4%, while the S&amp;P 500  rose 0.1%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
