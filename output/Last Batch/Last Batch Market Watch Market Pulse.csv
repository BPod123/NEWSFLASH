8,2023-09-21 02:28:27.078003,2023-09-20 20:11:00,"The Tell: Fed may need to raise interest rates up to three more times, Vanguard says","<p> Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesVanguard, the mutual-fund powerhouse with $8.1 trillion in assets under management as of August, said the Fed may need to continue hiking interest rates further than many policy makers expect and keep borrowing costs high through late 2024. In remarks released on Tuesday, Joseph Davis, chief global economist and head of the Vanguard Investment Strategy Group, cited a substantially higher neutral rate of interest since the 2007-2009 recession as one big reason why the central bank might need to hike one to three more times. A neutral rate of interest is the level of monetary policy that’s neither stimulating nor restricting economic growth. The higher it is, the tighter that Fed policy has to go in order to make a meaningful impact on the economy and inflation.  The view held by Davis is more hawkish than that of most officials on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, who have penciled in just one more rate hike this year before rate cuts begin in 2024. The fed funds rate target remains between 5.25%-5.5%, a 22-year high, after the Fed’s decision to pause on Wednesday and the comments from Davis imply that borrowing costs might possibly go to 6% or a bit higher — an opinion shared by just one person on the FOMC.Read: Fed skips rate hike for now, but doesn’t rule out another increase this yearDavis also put a 70% likelihood of the U.S. falling into a recession in the next 18 months, saying that “a soft landing is still possible, but not probable in our view, as it would require an unlikely ‘painless disinflation process'” — a scenario in which inflation moves back to the Fed’s 2% target without slowing demand in the world’s largest economy. Just hours ahead of the Fed’s policy announcement on Wednesday, Vanguard released a separate statement advising investors to avoid reacting to headlines and highlighting the benefits of a balanced portfolio.“Market timing is extremely difficult, even for professional investors, and is doomed to fail as a portfolio strategy,” according to Wednesday’s note by Todd Schlanger, a senior investment strategist at Valley Forge, Pa.-based Vanguard. “In Vanguard’s view, chasing performance and reacting to headlines are losing strategies and often result in buying high and selling low.”Vanguard’s research shows “that over a 25-year span, even when investors successfully anticipated economic surprises 100% of the time, their annualized return would have only been 0.2 percentage point higher than a traditional balanced portfolio of 60% U.S. stocks and 40% U.S. bonds.”The term 60/40 has been expanded over the years to include a range of other balanced allocations, such as those with a 70/30 or 80/20 mix of stocks and bonds. On Wednesday, U.S. stocks DJIA SPX COMP closed lower after the Fed’s policy update. Meanwhile, the 2-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y rose to its highest closing level since July 18, 2006. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

SPRY plunged 46.9% toward a 15-month low in premarket trading Wednesday, after the biopharmaceutical company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a Complete Response Letter regarding the New Drug Application for its epinephrine nasal spray Neffy. In the CRL, the FDA requested completion of a study assessing repeat doses of Neffy. The request comes after an FDA advisory panel recommended in May that Neffy be approved without additional studies. “We are very surprised by this action and the late requirement at this time to change the repeat-dose study from a post-marketing requirement, which we had previously aligned on with FDA, to a pre-approval requirement, particularly given the positive advisory committee vote,” said Chief Executive Richard Lowenthal. The stock, which is headed for the biggest one-day selloff since it went public in December 2020, has lost 22.6% year to date through Tuesday, while the iShares Biotechnology ETF IBB has lost 4.3% and the S&amp;P 500 SPX has gained 15.7%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The S&amp;P 500 SPX fell by 9.53 points, or 0.2%, to 4,443.99, according to preliminary closing data, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP shed 32.05 points, or 0.2%, to 13,678.19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell by 106.57 points, or 0.3%, to 34,517.73. U.S. stocks sunk as rising Treasury yields and higher oil prices put pressure on equities ahead of Wednesday’s interest-rate decision from the Federal Reserve. The central bank is widely expected to leave borrowing costs on hold, but could still rattle markets by leaving the door open for more interest-rate hikes at future meetings. Also on Tuesday, Maplebear Inc., which is doing business as Instacart CART, saw its shares climb 12.3% in its trading debut, which followed another successful offering from Arm Holdings last week. In addition to the Fed, investors will hear from a smattering of other central banks including the Bank of Japan and Bank of England later this week. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
