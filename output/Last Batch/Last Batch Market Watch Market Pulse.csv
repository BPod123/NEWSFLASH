In a filing, the company said the move to suspend those payments, made on Thursday, was “a measure of prudent oversight.” The move for the struggling bank, which teetered as its wealthy clients raced to get their money out following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, comes after it suspended its common-stock dividend last month. The bank received $30 billion in deposits last month from the nation’s largest financial institutions in an effort toward stabilizing the company. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

WMT this week sued credit-card giant Capital One Financial Corp. COF in an effort to scrap a credit-card partnership between the two, according to The Wall Street Journal. Walmart’s lawsuit alleged that Capital One came up short on its service obligations, failing to replace lost cards or post some transactions to customers’ accounts in a timely manner — claims the credit-card provider said were “immaterial,” the Journal said. A Capital One representative told the Journal it would “vigorously protect our contractual rights in court.” The Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, said Walmart had wanted to renegotiate certain agreement terms such as loss-sharing, and wanted its fintech segment to have a role in issuing cards. But Capital One balked, the Journal said. Capital One has been issuing Walmart’s credit cards since 2019, and the contract extends to at least 2026, the Journal said. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Barstool was founded in suburban Boston and has been based in Manhattan since 2016. It was acquired this year by Penn Entertainment Inc. PENN, which owns and manages gaming and racing facilities and slot-machine and related gambling operations. Barstool-branded sports bars have opened in recent years with locations in Chicago, Philadelphia and the Phoenix area, as has a Barstool sportsbook, which is legally operational in 15 states, including Illinois, according to Variety. Barstool has 641 employees, the careers site Zippia indicates. Barstool representative Debra Duffy said that some New York staff and talent will relocate to Chicago, while others will remain in New York and that New York would remain the headquarters location. It had previously been reported, including by MarketWatch, that the Chicago site would become the company’s headquarters.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The probability of a hike rose to 67.4% after the data, up from 49.2% a day earlier, according to data from the CME’s FedWatch tool. Analysts said the March jobs report would likely embolden the Fed to hike in May, as the labor market continued to see signs of strength last month. The U.S. economy created 236,000 jobs, just shy of the 238,000 median estimate from economists polled by the Wall Street Journal. Average hourly earnings for private-sector employees also slowed to 4.2% over the prior 12 months.

The data showed that the U.S. economy added 236,000 new jobs last month, roughly in line with expectations for 238,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate ticked lower to 3.5%, while the rate of increase in average hourly earnings for private employees slowed to 4.2%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y climbed 8.7 basis points to 3.372%, while the 2-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y climbed 10.8 basis points to 3.916%. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a gauge of the buck’s strength against a basket of rivals, gained 0.3% to 102.29.

SCHW said Thursday it recorded $53 billion in core net new client assets in its second-highest March result in its history. The financial services and brokerage firm said despot flows “have remained fairly consistent” during recent weeks of banking jitters. While money has flowed into higher-interest-paying money market funds, CDs and bonds from relatively lower-return accounts, that trend will start to level off because consumers still want to keep cash in a more “highly liquid” form, Schwab said. “History suggests the movement of cash into investments such as money markets, bonds and CDs reaches a peak and then returns back towards historical norms,” Schwab said. At Charles Schwab, so-called transactional cash that customers keep at the ready typically comprises about 5% to 10% of client assets. Charles Schwab stock is down 40.7% in 2023, compared to a 6.9% increase by the S&amp;P 500 SPX.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

JPM CEO Jamie Dimon said a rollback of banking regulations during the Trump administration was not to blame for the current banking crisis, in part two of an interview with CNN. Dimon said U.S. senators that have pointed to the banking changes as a factor in the blow-up of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank are mistaken. “Those senators are wrong,” Dimon said on CNN This Morning. “They still had higher liquidity and capital requirements and they met their exposure. It wasn’t the regulatory changes.” Dimon said JPMorgan’s role in providing $30 billion among banks to backstop a run on deposits at First Republic Bank FRC was “an attempt to give them time to resolve the situation” but did not provide additional details. Overall, Dimon said banks should be allowed to go out of business without posting a systemic risk.  “Failure is OK — you just don’t want the domino effect,” he said. Dimon said inflation will likely be here for longer than people expect, and that it’s also affecting long-term interest rates which are challenging permanent pools of capital such as sovereign wealth funds. In part one of his interview on Thursday night, Dimon said he thinks the U.S. is getting to the end of the current banking crisis, but that potential changes in regulations could have lasting effects. Shares of JPMorgan Chase are down 4.9% in 2023, compared to a 6.9% increase by the S&amp;P 500 SPX. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

OS was one of two primary endpoints; the other, progression-free survival, did show a statistically significant improvement in an earlier interim analysis of data. The partners said the Phase 3 LEAP-017 trial evaluating Keytruda plus Lenvima as a treatment for patients with unresectable and metastatic colorectal cancer also failed to meet the primary endpoint of OS.

Several auto makers aim to offer more EVs or transition to EVs only by 2030 or 2040, and California last year set a goal of banning sales of conventionally powered vehicles by 2035.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The drug was approved using the agency’s accelerate approval pathway in 2011 as a way to reduce the risk of pre-term birth in women pregnant with one baby who had a history of spontaneous pre-term birth. “It is tragic that the scientific research and medical communities have not yet found a treatment shown to be effective in preventing preterm birth and improving neonatal outcomes—particularly in light of the fact that this serious condition has a disparate impact on communities of color, especially Black women,” said FDA Commissioner, Dr. Robert M. Califf, in a statement. The move comes after the drug failed to verify clinical benefit in post marketing confirmatory study, leading its sponsor, Covis Pharma, to request a hearing, which was conducted in October of 2022.

26,2023-04-06 11:59:21.136438,2023-04-06 12:46:00,: Costco stock falls in premarket as March same-store sales fall short,"<p>Costco Wholesale Corp.  stock COST is down 2.5% in premarket trades after the retailing giant said its U.S. core March comparable stores sales grew by 2.6%, excluding impacts from changes in gasoline prices and foreign exchange. Analysts at Stifel said the core figure missed the Wall Street consensus estimate of 3.9%. Costco’s total same-store sales fell 1.1%, the first monthly same-store sales drop since April 2020. Stifel reiterated a buy rating on the stock but said the miss amounts to a “watchpoint for most retailers as Costco likely continues to outperform many peers.” Costco’s weakness in sales of non-foods “is most notable” because it likely results from “muted discretionary spending intentions given inflation and recent stock market and ongoing macroeconomic volatility,” Stifel analysts said. Costco stock is up 8.9% in 2023, compared to a 6.5% rise by the S&amp;P 500 SPX. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
