Chief Executive Elon Musk’s role in the EV maker’s self-driving car claims, Bloomberg reported Friday, citing a person familiar with the investigation. The review is part of the ongoing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s investigation of Tesla’s Autopilot, the EV maker’s suite of advanced driver-assistance systems, the report said. According to Bloomberg, the SEC is looking into whether Musk “may have inappropriately made forward-looking statements,” according to the unnamed source. Musk has made Autopilot a keystone of Tesla’s mission, but the system has been under criticism for overstating its ability and lulling drivers into a false sense of security. It is also the focus of multiple investigations by multiple agencies in recent years into crashes and malfunctions where it may have been involved. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
