COST — a master agreement the union said offered better pay and other benefits to more than 18,000 workers across the U.S. The agreement provides “significant wage improvements over the next three years and a substantial increase in pension contributions by the employer,” the union said. The contract also secured higher semi-annual bonuses and a “more flexible” attendance policy, according to a release. The union said 72% voted in favor of the agreement, which comes after Costco union members in June rejected an earlier contract offer. Mike Bergen, chair of the Teamsters Costco National Negotiating Committee, said in the release that workers “weren’t afraid to strike if necessary, and the company knew they weren’t bluffing.” Costco was not immediately available for comment. The announcement follows other union drives at Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Starbucks Corp. SBUX and other retailers. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move. Visit MarketWatch.com for more information on this news."

Then last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen acknowledged concerns about a potential breakdown in the trading of government debt and expressed worry about “a loss of adequate liquidity in the market.” Now, strategists at BofA Securities have identified a list of reasons why U.S. government bonds are exposed to the risk of “large scale forced selling or an external surprise” at a time when the bond market is in need of a reliable group of big buyers.“We believe the UST market is fragile and potentially one shock away from functioning challenges” arising from either “large scale forced selling or an external surprise,” said BofA strategists Mark Cabana, Ralph Axel and Adarsh Sinha. “A UST breakdown is not our base case, but it is a building tail risk.”In a note released Thursday, they said “we are unsure where this forced selling might come from,” though they have some ideas. The analysts said they see risks that could arise from mutual-fund outflows, the unwinding of positions held by hedge funds, and the deleveraging of risk-parity strategies that were put in place to help investors diversify risk across assets.  In addition, the events which could surprise bond investors include acute year-end funding stresses; a Democratic sweep of the midterm elections, which is not currently a consensus expectation; and even a shift in the Bank of Japan’s yield curve control policy, according to the BofA strategists. The BOJ’s yield curve control policy, aimed at keeping the 10-year yield on the country’s government bonds at around zero, is being pushed to a breaking point because of rising interest rates and yields worldwide. As a result, some expect the BOJ to tweak its policy, which was introduced in 2016 and is seen as increasingly out of line with other central banks.Read: Here’s what’s at stake for markets as Bank of Japan sticks to its dovish pathRight now, investors are grappling with a cauldron of risks: persistent U.S. and global inflation, accompanied by continued interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, as well as lingering uncertainty about where the world’s economy and financial markets are headed. U.S. officials are so concerned about the potential for a repeat of the September volatility which gripped the U.K. bond market, that Fed and White House officials reportedly spent last week asking investors and economists if a similar meltdown could happen here, according to the New York Times.Illiquidity in the ordinarily smooth-functioning Treasurys market means that government debt can’t be easily and quickly bought and sold without significantly impacting the underlying price of bonds — and that type of situation would theoretically translate into trouble for just about every other asset class. Expectations for a 5% or higher fed-funds rate target have the potential to trigger further bond selloffs, not long after investors finished wrapping their heads around a 4% level for interest rates. As of Friday, traders pulled back on the chances of a fed-funds rate target that gets to at least 5% next year, versus a current level between 3% and 3.25%, though they haven’t completely ruled out such a scenario.Treasury yields finished the New York session mostly lower on Friday, with the policy-sensitive 2-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD02Y dropping by the most in three weeks. Meanwhile, all three major U.S. indexes DJIASPXCOMP  ended higher for the day and the week, after a report by The Wall Street Journal raised investors’ hopes that the Fed might back off aggressive rate hikes.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Wall Street analysts currently expect Huntington Bancshares to generate $1.34 billion in net interest income in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet data.

The statement comes after the player was seen leaving the field before Wednesday's game was over even though additional substitutions were still available. Ronaldo was celebrated ahead of last weekend's game for scoring a record 700th club goal on Oct. 9. Despite the drama created by Ronaldo's early exit, Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said after a visit Wednesday to ""action-packed"" Old Trafford, which is Man Utd's home stadium, in which he saw a win and met with a number of executives, that he urges long-term investors to buy the stock as the team is expected to continue to perform well and as the club's brand grows. ""What's clear to us is Football is unlike any other sport in the world, [Man Utd's] ~1 billion followers globally show unmatched reach, leadership is focused, and [Man Utd] shares are disconnected from fair value,"" Konik wrote in a note to clients.
