NKLA said Friday that it will move its battery-making manufacturing operations to Arizona from California, as the Phoenix-based electric vehicle maker looks to “optimize” costs. The move is expected to be completed early in the third quarter, with the Cypress, Calif. production facility expected to close by July. “We are still in the process of evaluating how many jobs will be impacted,” a Nikola spokesperson said. “[S]ome employees will be given an opportunity to relocate,” the spokesperson added. After the move is completed, assembly of the company’s trucks and fuel cell power modules, and battery module and pack production, will all be in one facility. Nikola said it will maintain a battery engineering presence in a separate California facility. “This decision reinforces our commitment to finding ways to optimize our cost structure and create a sustainable business model,” said Nikola Chief Executive Michael Lohscheller. Nikola’s stock rose 1.6% to $2.55 on Friday. It has dropped 16.7% over the past three months, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has gained 11.6%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

MSGE on Friday said it would move ahead with a spin-off of its live entertainment business and planned to complete that spin-off by the end of March. Executives for the company said it had confidentially filed an amended registration statement for the proposed deal, and said it expected to file a publicly available registration statement next month. Shares were unchanged after hours. MSG in December said it was weighing separating its live entertainment segment as part of a “revised” spin-off plan approved by its board. The spin-off would be structured as tax-free to stockholders, the company said. Holders of Madison Square Garden Entertainment’s Class A and B shares would receive the equivalent of a roughly 67% stake in the live-entertainment company, which would keep the name Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp. The rest of that stake would be held by the current parent company, to be renamed MSG Sphere Corp.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Meanwhile, a golden cross for gold “should attract more buying from technically-oriented traders,” said Lundin. Gold for February delivery GCG23 rose $22.90, or 1.2%, to settle at $1,921.70 an ounce on Comex.
