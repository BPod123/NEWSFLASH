The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that the Chinese Politburo put out a statement asking stronger provinces to work to meet expansion targets, which was seen as a sign that country leaders may not currently expect other areas to hit their marks. Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares were off 8.5% in Friday's session and down 18.9% over the course of July. That would put the shares on track for their biggest monthly drop since November 2021, when they lost 22.7%, and the lowest monthly close since December 2016. The shares have also fallen 23.8% amid a three-week losing streak. Earlier this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Alibaba cofounder Jack Ma was preparing to give up control of Ant Group Co., the financial-technology company that's affiliated with Alibaba. Other U.S.-listed Chinese shares were falling as well Friday, including video platform iQiyi Inc. , down 7.5%.; video company Bilibili Inc. , down 4.6%, and e-commerce giant JD.com Inc. , down 4.3%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The stock has run up 20.6% during its win streak, which started after the stock closed at a 20-month low of $61.09 on July 14. Many on Wall Street define a bull market as gain of at least 20% off a bear-market low. Helping fuel the recent rally, the industrial conglomerate, which is planning to separate into three independent companies, reported on July 26 a big earnings beat and surprisingly positive free cash flow. An 11th-straight gain for the stock would be the longest such streak since FactSet data is available going back to January 1972. Since then, there have been three 10-day win streaks, that ended in July 2016, December 1999 and January 1987. There have also been three non-loss streaks of 11 days, which include days the stock was unchanged, that ended in February 1991, May 1990 and May 1981, and a 12-day non-loss streak that ended in November 1980. The stock has run up 15.7% in July, which would be the biggest one-month gain since it hiked up 17.4% in February 2021.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The stock has run up 28.8% in July, to snap a three-month losing streak in which it tumbled 34.8%, amid growing concerns over the effect historically high inflation and a slowing economy would have on the ecommerce giant's customers. But Amazon assuaged some of those fears, after it reported late Thursday a surprise loss for the quarter but revenue that rose above expectations, with Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky saying there was a ""step up in consumer demand,"" according to a FactSet transcript of the post-earnings conference call with clients. The stock was headed for the biggest one-month gain since it rocketed 54.1% in April 2007.

The company said it will consider all options to ""vigorously defend"" the patents when the court enters a final order. ""We are disappointed with today's development,"" said Chief Executive Thomas Appio. ""We strongly disagree with any conclusion that our patents are not valid and intend to file an appeal to any such order.""

Musk agreed in April to purchase Twitter for $44 billion, but he said in early July that he was terminating the deal due to his concerns over the accuracy of Twitter's public disclosures on bot accounts. Twitter is seeking to move forward with the merger under the original terms and recently scheduled a Sept. 13 shareholder vote on the matter. Twitter shares are up 1.5% in Friday morning trading.

""We are not convinced 'corporate cannabis' can create compelling products or brands in Canada,"" Hickey said.

On the plus side, Tilray's 2023 outlook exceeded consensus view by analysts and it beat its fourth-quarter targets for revenue and adjusted profit. But Hickey said he remains cautious that ""newly announced profit growth primarily reflects newly announced revenue and cost synergies and are potentially masking continued deterioration from its core Canadian cannabis business.""

The reasoning is that it'll be worth it for those under 50 to wait slightly longer for the improved booster, rather than expand eligibility now with the older shot. While the older version is still highly effective at preventing serious symptoms and death, the new, omicron-specific boosters are expected to provide better defense against BA.5, though data on that is still preliminary.  The news comes as the daily average for new U.S. cases remains close to 130,000 a day, but not all data are being captured as many people are testing at home. The average stoold at 127,022 on Thursday, according to a New York Times tracker, down 2% from two weeks ago. The daily average for hospitalizations rose to 43,696 up 10% in two weeks. The daily average for deaths is up 4% to 438.  Globally, the confirmed case tally rose above 574.8 million on Thursday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins, while the death toll is above 6.39 million with the U.S. leading the world with 91.1 million cases and 1,029,270 deaths.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
