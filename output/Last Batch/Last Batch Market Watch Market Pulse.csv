Jounce will receive $67 million, and Gilead will be solely responsible moving forward for the drug, which is in Phase 1 clinical development for treatment of solid tumors. “It was important for Jounce at this time to bolster our cash resources, given challenges in capital markets for biotech companies,” Jounce Chief Executive Richard Murray said in a statement. Jounce stood to receive milestone payments up to $645 million as well as royalty payments in the future if the drug proved successful. Gilead stated that annual earnings would be about 4 cents less this year than previously stated due to incurring expenses related to the drug.
