Net income for the quarter to July 30 sank to $183 million, or 39 cents a share, from $1.82 billion, or $3.65 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share of 39 cents missed the FactSet EPS consensus of 79 cents. Gross margin contracted to 21.5% from 30.4%. ""This year's gross margin rate reflected higher markdown rates, driven primarily by inventory impairments and actions taken to address lower-than-expected sales in discretionary categories, as well as higher merchandise, inventory shrink, and freight costs,"" the company said. Higher pay for workers, increased headcount in distribution centers and costs of managing excess inventory also pressured margins. Total revenue grew 3.5% to $26.04 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $26.03 billion, while same-store sales growth of 2.6% was below expectations for a 2.8% rise. The company affirmed its fiscal 2022 revenue growth guidance in the low- to mid-single digit percentage range, while the current FactSet consensus of $109.83 billion implies 3.6% growth. The stock has dropped 16.3% over the past three months through Tuesday, while shares of rival Walmart Inc.  have gained 6.1% and the S&amp;P 500  has advanced 5.3%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The trial tracked COVID infections among a group of 144 participants all of whom had Type 1 diabetes, with two-thirds receiving at least 3 doses of BCG, or  Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin, shots, which protect people by bolstering the immune system. The results found just 1% of the 96 people who got the BCG shots developed COVID, while 12% of the placebo recipients got the virus. The data are still being evaluated. The move comes as U.S. known cases of COVID are continuing to ease, although the true tally is likely higher given how many people are testing at home, where the data are not being collected. The daily average for new cases stood at 100,747 on Tuesday, according to a New York Times tracker, down 18% from two weeks ago. Cases are falling in almost every state and are down 20% or more in more than a dozen states. The daily average for hospitalizations was down 45 at 41,668, while the daily average for deaths is up 4% to 467.  Globally, the confirmed case tally rose above 592.3 million on Tuesday, according to data aggregated by Johns 2Hopkins, while the death toll is above 6.44 million with the U.S. leading the world with 93.1 million cases and 1,037,970 deaths.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
