TEAM announced Monday it will lay off 500 workers, about 5% of the company, as cutbacks in the tech sector continue. In a blog post, co-founders and co-Chief Executives Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar said that the cuts will be focused on recruiting, program management and research, and that savings will be reinvested in other areas of the company. “This is different to a financially-driven reduction, where you would look to make ‘broad-based cuts’ – for example, a 10% cut equally distributed across every org within the company,” they wrote. “This is not what is happening here.” Affected employees will have the option of remaining and communicating with their teams until the end of the week, the CEOs said. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Atlassian disclosed that the layoffs will result in $70 million to $75 million in charges in the fiscal third quarter, with $27 million to $29 million in cash charges and the rest non-cash, such as accelerated vesting of stock and office-space reductions. Atlassian — known for software programs such as Jira and Confluence — has seen its stock decline by 34.2% in the past 12 months, as the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has declined 6.5%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

ABNB has laid off 30% of its recruiting staff as it slows hiring, a company spokesperson confirmed Monday. That works out to about 27 or 28 people out of the company’s overall workforce of more than 6,800. “We have made the difficult decision to reorganize and reduce the size of our recruiting team to reflect our hiring projections,” the spokesperson said, adding that the move doesn’t mean there will be wider layoffs at the company. The move comes after Chief Executive Brian Chesky said during Airbnb’s earnings call last month that “we’re one of the few tech companies that isn’t doing layoffs” and that the only hiring the company would be doing is for “key positions.” Chief Financial Officer Dave Stephenson said on the call — during which he reported record fourth-quarter revenue, Airbnb’s first profitable year and an outlook that beat expectations — that the company would grow headcount “modestly” this year, in the 2%, 3% or 4% range. The last time Airbnb laid off employees was at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, when it cut 1,900 positions, or 25% of its workforce.

Citing people familiar with the matter, the WSJ report said Paramount was looking to boost its finances by selling off the bulk of BET Media, which includes the cable TV channels BET and VH1, so it can support its Paramount+ streaming service. Although BET and its BET+ streaming service have strong brands, it would be a challenge for Paramount to fold the service into Paramout+, because Tyler Perry owns a minority stake in BET+, the WSJ reports said. In late February, the WSJ had reported that Paramount had turned down a $3 billion bid from former executive David Nevins to buy its Showtime streaming service.

Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons, economists at Jefferies JEF, said they foresee a gain of 290,000 for last month. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, on average, expect February payrolls to have grown by 225,000.A stronger-than-expected jobs report has the potential to trigger another round of repricing in financial markets similar to the one seen after January’s nonfarm payroll report. As of Monday afternoon, a day before the start of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s semiannual testimony to Congress, all three major U.S. stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP were moving higher, while Treasury yields were little changed.“February’s jobs data probably has more of an ability to move markets than January’s report because there’s very heightened sensitivity to any suggestion of the economy overheating,” said Will Compernolle, a macro strategist at FHN Financial in New York. “January’s data was really hot, but because of seasonal-adjustment issues, markets are still clinging on to the  hope that it was a bit of a fluke. If it’s a really above-consensus jobs report, that will be under the magnifying glass much more so than if it is below consensus, in which case markets would look past it as insufficient comfort.”Read: Why the February jobs report is unlikely to reverse a January blowout in this week’s key economic data releaseThe 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10, a benchmark rate for everything from mortgages to student and automobile loans, hovered around 3.96% Monday, down from an intraday high of 4.08% reached last week.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
