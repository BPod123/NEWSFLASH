The S&amp;P 500 SPX finished 50.66 points, or 1.4%, higher at 3,770.55, but still logged a weekly loss of 3.4% its worst weekly performance in about a month, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

26,2022-11-05 02:11:17.851876,2022-11-03 17:48:00,: U.S. oil futures down 2% as the Fed rate hike boosts the dollar,"<p>U.S. oil futures declined by 2% on Thursday, with prices pressured by strength in the U.S. dollar and worries that aggressive rate hikes by Federal Reserve will lead to an economic recession. Concerns that the Fed is “much more likely to overshoot on rates rather than doing too little” have grown, raising the risk of the economy “tipping” into recession, said Robbie Fraser, manager, global research and analytics at Schneider Electric. That’s a particularly “bearish prospect for crude prices due to the potential demand hit, and is further reinforced by the stronger dollar that weighs on dollar-denominated crude prices.” U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery CLZ22 fell $1.83, or 2%, to settle at $88.17 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices on Wednesday had settled at $90, the highest front-month contract finish since Oct. 10, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Politico reported that the Justice Department was planning to open an in-depth investigation of the $20 billion deal, citing four unnamed sources. The report noted that regulators have reached out to ""customers and competitors"" of both companies. An Adobe spokesperson said in a statement that the two companies ""are not meaningful competitors"" and that the acquisition ""will deliver tremendous value to consumers"" by bringing together ""complementary yet distinct"" areas. ""Given the current political climate around antitrust, it's not surprising to see an acquisition of this magnitude receive regulatory attention,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Matthew Swanson wrote Wednesday evening. ""That said, we continue to view the acquisition as more offensive, focused on addressing new use cases within web and mobile app design as well as a different user base with two-thirds of Figma users being developers and not designers."" He added that ""additional regulatory scrutiny would likely at the very least delay the close date"" but said that most of the investors he's talked to ""have anticipated this being an elongated process.""</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
