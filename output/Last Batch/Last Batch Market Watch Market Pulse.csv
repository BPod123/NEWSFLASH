Inflation is usually a boon for bullion but the prospect of higher rates is dulling the appeal of gold against Treasury yields, which also were seeing their rates rising. February gold   on Thursday ended down $35.90, or 2%, to reach $1,789.20 an ounce. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Humana's stock was headed for the biggest one-day selloff since it slid 13.9% on March 16, 2020. Humana disclosed earlier Thursday that it now expects 2022 net membership growth for its individual Medicare Advantage products of 150,000 to 200,000 members, down from a previous estimate of 325,000 to 375,000 due primarily to ""higher than anticipated terminations"" during the annual election period, combined with expectations of higher than originally expected terminations for the rest of 2022. The company expects 2022 adjusted earnings per share of approximately $20.50, compared with the FactSet consensus of $20.53. Meanwhile, for the Humana Premier Rx Plan (PDP), the company now estimates a net membership decline of 125,000 members in 2022, compared with previous estimates of a loss of ""a few hundred thousand members,"" citing better-than-expected sales of the Walmart Value plan and lower-than-anticipated terminations. Among other health insurers, shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc.  dropped 1.9% and Anthem Inc.  slumped 1.6%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
