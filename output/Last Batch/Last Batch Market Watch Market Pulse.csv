We believe this disproportionately impacted our consumer and impacted our sales in the important first quarter of the year.” The company also had high levels of inventory that required an elevated level of promotional activity, he said. Birmingham, Alabama-based Hibbett had net income of $35.9 million, or $2.74 a share, for the quarter to April 29, down from $39.3 million, or $2.89 a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 7.4% to $455.5 million from $424.1 million. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of $3.00 and sales of $460.0 million. Same-store sales rose 4.1%, also below the FactSet consensus of a rise of 4.8%. The company is now expecting full-year EPS to range from $7.00 to $7.55, compared with prior guidance of $9.50 to $10.00. It expects sales to be flat to up 2%, versus prior guidance of up in mid-single digits. The stock  has fallen 35% in the year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has gained 8%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

They say odds are highest that a deal will be announced late Friday or Saturday. They give an 80% chance to a full-fledged deal, a 10% probability of a short-term patch and a 10% chance Congress doesn’t act in time.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

F said late Thursday that its electric-vehicle owners soon will have access to the more than 12,000 Tesla Inc. TSLA superchargers in the U.S. and Canada, as the two automakers have reached an agreement scheduled to start in a year. Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk held a Twitter “spaces” talk to reveal the agreement. Tesla will develop an adapter for the Ford EVs., but within two years Ford will equip future EVs with the same charge port and newer vehicles won’t need the adapter. Musk said he wasn’t sure about the price of the adapter but that it would be in the hundreds of dollars range, unlikely to cost above $1,000.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

COF and KeyCorp’s KEY KeyBank after the two banks failed to submit required plans showing their efforts to halt discrimination, the city’s comptroller said in a statement on Thursday, alleging that the banks “outright refused to submit required policies.” The comptroller, Brad Lander, also voted against designating Wells Fargo & Co. WFC , PNC Financial Services Group Inc.’s PNC PNC Bank and International Finance Bank to hold public funds, that statement said. “Unfortunately, despite several opportunities to do so, five banks failed to comply with the New York City Banking Commission’s designation process – leaving us to conclude that they are not taking meaningful actions to combat discrimination in their operations and are not responsible stewards of public dollars,” Lander said. All three members of the banking commission — which include the comptroller, mayor and finance commissioner — voted to take the action against Capital One and KeyCorp, which respectively held $7.2 million and $10 million in city deposits at the end of last month. Both can service existing contracts for one year under the move. The commission in February said that banks had to “submit to demonstrate a meaningful commitment to combat discrimination in employment, services, and lending,” the statement said. Shares of Capital One slipped 0.7% after hours, while Key was 0.3% lower.  </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
