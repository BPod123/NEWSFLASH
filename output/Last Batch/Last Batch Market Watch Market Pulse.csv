UAL Chief Executive Scott Kirby on Friday apologized for taking a flight on a private jet earlier in the week, while thousands of the airline’s passengers were left stranded amid a wave of flight cancellations. “Taking a private jet was the wrong decision because it was insensitive to our customers who were waiting to get home,” Kirby said in a statement after flying from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey to Denver on Wednesday, according to the Wall Street Journal and other news outlets. “I sincerely apologize to our customers and our team members who have been working around-the-clock for several days — often through severe weather — to take care of our customers.” United told the Journal that the air carrier didn’t pay for Kirby’s flight, and that he took it after he couldn’t get a seat on a commercial flight.

The specialty retailer, which has pierced the ears of millions of tweens and teen girls and sold them often-colorful jewelry, accessories and toys, filed to become a public company in September 2021.

In the filing Friday, the company did not say what led to its decision to withdraw, sharing only that “it has decided not to proceed with the offering at this time.” The IPO market has shown some green shoots in recent weeks, including the debut of three companies this week, but the results have been mixed. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

6,2023-06-30 18:05:54.195442,2023-06-30 20:15:00,Market Extra: What’s at stake for stock and bond investors in second half of 2023,"<p>Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesThere’s a lot riding for stock and bond investors in the second half of the year, with the biggest question centered around whether the idea of “immaculate disinflation” can come fully to fruition.The term refers to the notion that inflation might meaningfully dissipate from here, without a significant uptick in U.S. unemployment or a major recession. It’s considered to be the perfect scenario for investors and policy makers, who want inflation back down to their 2% target, and one in which the Federal Reserve’s main policy rate target wouldn’t need to go much higher from its current level between 5%-5.25%.What makes the path ahead so tricky is that core readings that represent the purest reads on inflation are proving to be stubborn and it isn’t clear whether they’ll turn meaningfully lower, fast. If they don’t, that would likely put pressure on central bankers to keep up their inflation fight and has the potential to drive up interest-rate expectations, as well as Treasury yields. Though the bond market has come around to the fact there won’t likely be any rate cuts by the Fed soon, it still isn’t completely on board with the idea of higher rates for longer — which, in turn, is helping to support equities for now.“The problem for the disinflation people or believers is that the core readings continue to come in too high,” said Jeffrey Cleveland, director and chief economist at Payden & Rygel, a Los Angeles-based investment management firm that oversees $148.9 billion in assets. Friday’s core reading from the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — known as the PCE — was 0.3% for the month of May, and has been at or above that mark for six straight months. Via phone, Cleveland said his firm expects the monthly core PCE rate to end the year above 0.3%, but “you need monthly core PCE readings to be 0.1% or 0.2% to see meaningful disinflation.” If inflation surprises to the upside, “the whole Treasury curve moves up, with the 2-year rate most susceptible,” which would likely dent the performance of stocks. Cleveland said he expects the policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y to get back to 5% by December — a level that was last seen in March.The first six months of this year have turned out to be great for U.S. equities, with the Nasdaq-100 NDX scoring its best first-half performance on record, as investors came around to the idea that the economy is resilient enough to absorb higher rates. The unemployment rate stood at 3.7% as of May as the U.S. added a shockingly large number of jobs, while annual core readings from the consumer-price index and PCE index came in at 5.3% and 4.6%, respectively, for May.Read:How stocks and every other major asset have performed in first half of 2023 — and over the last 18 monthsMeanwhile, the benchmark 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, which reflects investors’ long-term U.S. outlook, has remained relatively contained near 3.75% for months as robust U.S. data rolled in, accompanied by signs of overall inflation easing when waning gas and food prices are factored in.Data released this week reaffirmed that the U.S. economy and labor market are holding up, despite 5 percentage points of Fed rate hikes since March 2022. With policy makers signaling two more hikes may be on the way starting in July, the risk is that the economy continues to prove resistant to policy makers’ actions and requires even more tightening.“Not only is the U.S. economy continuing to prove resilient in the face of significantly tighter monetary policy, but it also appears the starting point of the economy for 2023 was even higher than previously anticipated with the consumer proving to be an even stronger force across the first three months,” said Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. economists Lindsey Piegza and Lauren Henderson, in a note this week. Via phone, Henderson said her Chicago-based firm isn’t buying into the “immaculate disinflation” theory yet and thinks inflation “is proving stickier and more persistent than many expected.” Stifel, which updates its forecasts on a quarterly basis, is standing by its year-end expectations for the 2- and 10-year Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y to be at 4.65% and 3.45%, respectively, she said. That’s below the current levels for those rates because Stifel economists foresee a short, shallow recession “sometime in the fourth quarter or beyond,” as policy makers push the fed-funds rate target up to 5.75% by year-end and stay there through 2024, according to Henderson.Inside the market for fixings, or derivatives-like instruments in which bets can be made on upcoming consumer-price index reports, traders have been coalescing around the view that the annual headline CPI rate is likely to start falling toward 2% this year. They even see the core CPI reading dropping to roughly 2.5% annually and to 0.2% monthly, in relatively quick fashion. However, one big name has a warning. Former New York Fed President Bill Dudley said inflation could easily go higher than his estimated 2.5% long-term average, and that the 10-year Treasury yield might even go above his “conservative” estimate of 4.5%. On Friday, financial markets were focused on the positive aspects of the PCE report, with all three major U.S. stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP finishing higher. Meanwhile, Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD30Y ended mostly lower — except for the 2-year rate, which was little changed.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

7,2023-06-30 18:05:54.195442,2023-06-30 20:04:00,": Stocks end higher Friday, as Nasdaq scores best first half of a year since 1983","<p>U.S. stocks closed higher Friday, ending the month and the first half of 2023 with robust gains as a long-anticipated economic recession failed to materialize. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose about 283 points on Friday, or 0.8%, ending near 34,405, according to preliminary FactSet data. It gained 4.6% in June and 3.8% over the year’s opening six months, its best first half since 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Stocks have been in rally mode in 2023 as inflation continued to retreat under a regime of sharply higher interest rates. The bullish tone, especially for a select few technology stocks, has endured even as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell repeatedly said a few more interest-rate increases look likely this year, and that rates will likely stay high for awhile. Yet the U.S. economy hasn’t tipped into a recession, suggesting the Fed might have room to pull off a “soft landing” for the economy, or at least only a mild recession, as it fights to bring down the cost of living to its 2% annual target. On Friday, the personal-consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation gauge, eased to a 3.8% annual rate in May, the slowest level since April 2021. Against that backdrop, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX rose 1.2% on the session, 2.3% in June and 15.9% in the first half, its best start to a year since 2019. But the Nasdaq Composite Index was the standout, gaining 1.5% on Friday and 31.7% in the first half of 2023, which was its best first half since 1983, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

GBX gained 2.4% toward a 13-month high in afternoon trading Friday, to put them on track for the biggest monthly gain in 14 years in the wake of the railcar maker’s second-straight blowout earnings report. The stock had rocketed a record 31.8% on Thursday after the company reported fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.02, or 71% above the FactSet consensus of 60 cents, which followed a 63% beat in the first quarter. Revenue jumped 31% to $1.04 billion, well above the FactSet consensus of $904.2 million, and to beat expectations for the seventh-straight quarter. Thursday’s gain helped propel the stock to a 61.3% rally in June, which would be the biggest one-month gain since it rocketed a record 132.5% in April 2009. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 SPX has tacked on 6.6% in June.

AMZN climbed 1.9% toward a 9 1/2-month high in afternoon trading Friday, putting them on track to produce a four-month winning streak. The stock has rallied 8.1% in June, as investors gird for the ecommerce giant’s annual Prime Day sales event in mid-July. The stock has soared 38.3% over the past four months, compared with a 12.3% rise in the S&amp;P 500 SPX over the same period. That would be the longest monthly win streak for Amazon’s stock since the four-month stretch that ended January 2020, which was before the COVID-19 pandemic. It would also be the stock’s best four-month performance since it shot up 39.5% in August 2020, boosted by the COVID-induced explosion in online shopping. J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth reiterated overweight rating in a recent note to clients, saying he projects Amazon to get about a $5 billion revenue boost from next month’s Prime Day, or about 13% more than last year. “Importantly, 2023 is tracking toward the fastest Prime delivery speeds ever, which we believe helps drive higher customer consideration and purchase frequency,” Anmuth wrote.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The cruise operator’s stock has climbed 18.5% this week, 66.8% in June and and 84.5% during the second quarter, enough to make it the S&amp;P 500’s SPX best performer in all three time periods. Helping fuel the stock’s rocket ride were fiscal second-quarter results that showed record demand. The next best weekly S&amp;P 500 performers this week are home generator maker Generac Holdings Inc.’s stock GNRC, which has rallied 15.8%, and casino operator Caesars Entertainment Inc. shares CZR, which have climbed 13.2%.
