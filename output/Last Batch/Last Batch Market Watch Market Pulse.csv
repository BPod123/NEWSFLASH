Investors were still trying to wrap their heads around the likelihood that the fed-funds rate target will likely rise above 4% by year-end, and the stock market sold off on Friday — fueled by a profit warning by FedEx Corp. FDX, along with inflation and rate fears.Few market participants have openly talked about the prospect of an almost 5% fed-funds rate target, essentially double the current level of 2.25% to 2.5%. Such a scenario could have an even more punishing effect on stocks than what’s been predicted by billionaire investor and hedge-fund manager Ray Dalio, who estimates that a 4.5% level on rates would produce a 20% negative impact on equity prices. Meanwhile, one key market rate — the one-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD01Y — hovered near 4% on Friday, a development that some say could spill over into other rates and exacerbate worries throughout financial markets, in the U.S. and abroad. Deutsche Bank’s revised interest-rate forecast “is all about the inflation profile and how we expect inflation to remain at higher levels for longer,” Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist, said via phone. “The Fed has always gotten the fed-funds rate target above inflation during all of its past tightening cycles, whether inflation was high or not.”“For policy to be restrictive, real or inflation-adjusted rates need to be positive and, right now, Fed officials can’t rely on forecasts about inflation to decline over time,” he told MarketWatch. “For them to have confidence, they need to get the fed-funds rate above inflation, at least by early next year,” he said, although Deutsche Bank doesn’t expect an almost 5% fed-funds rate to be sustained for very long.  Deutsche Bank’s U.S. economists revised their expectations after Tuesday’s unexpectedly hot consumer-price index report for August, and the upgrade is now closer to the 5% to 6% range that some at the bank think is needed to cool inflation.Friday brought another downbeat day in financial markets, with all three major stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP finishing lower after trimming earlier heavy losses. FedEx’s profit warning was being read by some, such as BNP Paribas Chief U.S. Economist Carl Riccadonna, as fitting into his view that a “massive deceleration” is under way for the U.S. economy.Deutsche Bank was the first major Wall Street bank to call a U.S. recession in April. That same month, it went out further on a limb to say that it saw downside risk to its own pessimistic view. In June, Tim Wessel, a macro strategist, said he saw a chance that inflation fails to decelerate. And just three days ago, Henry Allen, a research analyst, said “that the pessimists will sadly prevail on this occasion” when it comes to the debate over whether the U.S. economy can achieve a soft landing.  On Friday, Deutsche Bank was joined by Dutch financial-services company Rabobank, with another take on the prospect of higher-than-expected rates. Strategist Philip Marey said Rabobank now expects the fed-funds rate to peak at 5% next year, up from its prior forecast of 4.5%, given persistent inflation and a wage-price spiral that’s already under way. Rabobank also doesn’t expect the Fed to pivot from its rate stance before 2024.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The company said WHO updated its guidelines to recommend the drug to treat patients with severe COVID, an expansion from simply ""those with non-severe COVID-19 at the highest risk of hospitalization."" In late July, European Commission regulators recommended that Veklury be used as an expanded COVID-19 treatment. The move comes as U.S. known cases of COVID are continuing to ease, although the true tally is likely higher given how many people are testing at home, where the data are not being collected. The daily average for new cases stood at 64,308 on Thursday, according to a New York Times tracker, down 28% from two weeks ago. The daily average for hospitalizations was down 11% at 33,143while the daily average for deaths is down 4% to 491.  Globally, the confirmed case tally rose above 611 million on Friday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins, while the death toll is above 6.52 million with the U.S. leading the world with 95.6 million cases and 1,052,939 deaths.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
