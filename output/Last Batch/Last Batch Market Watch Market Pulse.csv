White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that the administration is glad the Swiss central bank gave a reassurance in the form of a loan facility, and noted that the U.S. Treasury is in touch with its Swiss counterparts. As MarketWatch reported, Credit Suisse shares surged Thursday, rallying as the Swiss banking giant said it will tap its central bank for 50 billion francs ($54 billion) and launching an offer to buy beaten-up debt.    </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2,2023-03-16 15:13:44.947404,2023-03-16 16:19:00,: Group of licensed medical cannabis operators file suit against New York regulator for failing to open licensing to all applicants at the same time,"<p>A coalition of licensed medical cannabis operators has filed a lawsuit against the New York cannabis regulator, alleging it overstepped its authority and subverted the intent of the state legislature by failing to comply with provisions of the 2021 Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act, or MRTA. The Cannabis Control Board and Office of Cannabis Management “established policies that undermine the MRTA’s laudable social equity goals and hinder licensed operators from entering the market. These policies have delayed the availability of safe, regulated cannabis products for medical patients and adult-use consumers in New York State,” the Coalition for Access to Regulated & Safe Cannabis said in a statement. The group argues that the MRTA required that the OCM And CCB open the initial adult-use retail dispensary license application period to all candidates at the same time. But instead, they created a program called the Conditional Adult-Use Retail Dispensary (CAURD) program that effectively created a new license class and allowed that group access before others.  The CAURD program was announced last March with the intention of granting the first licenses to individuals who had prior cannabis-related convictions that occurred in New York state.  But some applicants have challenged the program arguing it conflicts with the US Dormant Commerce Clause, which blocks states from discriminating against interstate commerce. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

ROTCE is calculated by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly tangible common shareholders’ equity. Citi continues to benefit from high capital levels, ample liquidity and “sticky” operational deposits, Usdin said. “While Citi is mindful of the more uncertain operating environment and current volatility, the bank’s overall strategic plan is intact, including its divestiture strategy, growth priorities, and cost reduction plans,” Usdin said. Citi stock is up 0.2% in premarket trades. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move. Visit MarketWatch.com for more information on this news."
