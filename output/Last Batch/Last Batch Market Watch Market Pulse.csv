SPR dropped 4.5% in premarket trading Wednesday, after the maker of components used in commercial and defense aircraft reported a much wider-than-expected loss and revenue that came up short, and said a quality issue on components used in Boeing Co.’s BA 737 planes hurt results. Net losses widened to $281.2 million, or $2.68 a share, from $52.8 million, or 51 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, the adjusted per-share loss of $1.69 was much wider than the FactSet loss consensus of 29 cents. Revenue grew 21.8% to $1.43 billion, but was below the FactSet consensus of $1.52 billion. The company said it notified Boeing of a “quality issue” on the vertical fin attach fittings of certain models of the 737 fuselage that Spirit manufactures, and worked with Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration to confirm it was not an immediate safety of flight issue. Spirit costs from disruptions and rework of the Wichita factory in which the quality issue stemmed is expected to cut profit by $31 million in 2023, of which $17 million was reflected in first-quarter results. “Additional costs are expected, including costs Boeing may assert to repair certain models of previously delivered units in their factory and warranty costs related to affected 737 units in service,” Spirit said in a statement. Spirit’s stock has tumbled 13.0% over the past three months through Tuesday while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has slipped 0.4%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

SMCI shares jumped more than 8% in after-hours trading Tuesday, following an earnings report that showed stronger-than-expected earnings and guidance. Super Micro reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $86 million, or $1.53 a share, on revenue of $1.28 billion, down from $1.36 billion a year ago.

Analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of $1.29 a share on revenue of $1.28 billion, according to FactSet. Super Micro Chief Executive Charles Liang said that demand for gear that can handle generative artificial intelligence is leading to greater demand, but that component shortages pushed some orders out of the quarter. “These new AI product demands from top-tier companies have led us to challenges in terms of new key components availability,” he said, but later said the problem had been addressed, and “we have started to produce and ship some back orders since April.” That optimism showed up in Super Micro’s forecast, which called for fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.21 to $2.71 a share on net sales of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. That guidance blew away the average analyst estimate, which called for adjusted earnings of  $1.76 a share on sales of $1.64 billion, according to FactSet.

The Energy Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund XLE sank 4.4% toward a five-week low, with all 23 equity components losing ground.

The biggest XLE decliner was Halliburton Co.’s stock HAL, which dove 8.0%, while Occidental Petroleum Corp.’s stock OXY was the best performer, but still lost 2.2%.

23,2023-05-03 00:11:22.519420,2023-05-02 17:59:00,": Gold futures climb past $2,000; silver prices rally","<p>Gold futures rallied past $2,000 an ounce on Tuesday to finish at their highest since mid-April. Concerns surrounding the banking sector have provided support for haven gold, ahead of the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates Wednesday. Gold could potentially reach $2,300 on “indications of a Fed pause in the hiking cycle,” said Robert Minter, director of ETF Investment Strategy at abrdn. Silver prices also rallied Tuesday. Silver may benefit from a gold-like demand increase as the Fed pauses, the U.S. dollar weakens and gold prices rise, and if Chinese and European economies continue to outperform expectations and offset any U.S. weakness, said Minter. Gold for June delivery GCM23 settled at $2,023.30 an ounce on Comex, up $31.10, or 1.6% for the session. The settlement was the highest for a most-active contract since April 13, FactSet data show. July silver SIN23 climbed 39 cents, or 1.5%, to settle at $25.62 an ounce.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The company said the Phase 3 trial of Sparsentan as a treatment for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, did not meet the primary efficacy eGFR slope endpoint over 108 weeks of treatment.  The eGFR slope is used to measure renal function. FSGS is a disease that causes scarring of the kidneys and is a common cause of acquired glomerular disease leading to end stage kidney disease.  It’s estimated to affect more than 40,000 patients in the U.S. The trial involved 371 patients. The company is now planning to explore a path forward with regulators for a supplemental New Drug Application in the U.S. “We are disappointed that we did not achieve the primary efficacy endpoint in this study, but we did see results that trended favorably for sparsentan that we are further exploring to determine a potential path forward in FSGS,” said Dr. Eric Dube, CEO of Travere. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Fed funds futures traders see a 59% chance that the Fed’s main policy rate target will drop to between 4.25% and 4.5%, or even lower, versus a 28% chance seen on Monday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. That implies at least three quarter-point rate cuts this year, after accounting for a widely expected quarter-point rate hike on Wednesday that would take the fed funds rate target to between 5% and 5.25%. On Tuesday, Treasury yields outside the T-bill space fell broadly lower and all three major stock indexes were down, as Dow industrials dropped more than 570 points in late-morning trading.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
