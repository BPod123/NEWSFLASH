Shares have fallen nearly 66% in the past year, as growth has slowed down and executives have blamed the U.S. healthcare system, noting that it does not universally pay for the type of insulin pumps that Tandem sells. Executives also provided a preliminary 2023 forecast that calls for 11% to 12% sales growth from 2022’s total, which suggests an annual total approaching $900 million. Analysts on average were projecting 2023 revenue of $890.6 million, according to FactSet. Executives expect to release full fourth-quarter results on Feb. 22. Shares closed Tuesday with a 1.6% decline at $44.42 before moving to $47.50 in the extended session after the news was released.  </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

CVNA jumped 2.4% in premarket trading Tuesday, after the online used-car retailer said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, in an effort to block investors from buying up a stake while the stock price is depressed. The stock has tumbled 61.5% over the past three months through Friday, and plummeted 95.5% over the past 12 months, amid liquidity concerns due to falling used-car demand and and reports of continued layoffs. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 SPX has gained 8.7% the past three months. Carvana said Friday that the rights plan, also known on Wall Street as a “poison pill,” is designed to protect long-term shareholder value by preserving the availability of its “significant” net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs), which could be available to offset future taxable income. But the ability to use NOLs would be “substantially limited” if its 5%-shareholders increased their stake by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. So the rights plan, which the company referred to as a Tax Asset Preservation Plan, will become exercisable if an investor acquires 4.9% or more of Carvana’s outstanding common stock. Also under the plan, current shareholders that currently own at least a 4.9% stake may not buy more stock without triggering the plan.

A company spokesperson had told MarketWatch on Friday that the company doesn’t comment on rumors or speculation.

Investors also cheered signs that the U.S. labor market has remained strong, absorbing layoffs from a spate of firms in the finance, technology and media spaces.

However, some economists have highlighted signs of trouble brewing beneath the surface, as the pace of consumption growth appears to have slowed, and other signs show a slowdown in spending on consumer goods in the face of inflation. Cyclical sectors including consumer discretionary stocks,  communications services stocks — a sector that includes many megacap technology names and media companies — information technology, materials and financials led performance on the S&amp;P 500.

HUBS said Tuesday it would layoff about 7% of its workforce, or about 500 employees, as part of a plan to cut costs.

Biden spoke after the U.S. reported that the number of new jobs created in January rose by 517,000, marking the biggest gain in six months.

Employment grew even faster in the waning months of 2022 than previously reported, indicating the labor market was still quite robust. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Revenue rose 23% to $1.320 billion, also short of the $1.424 billion FactSet consensus. Chief  Executive Tom Gentile said it was a challenging year for the entire industry.

The changes in estimates related to the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 programs, which were hit by higher labor, freight and rework costs and parts shortages.

2023-02-10 21:05:00,": Dow ends up 170 points Friday, but Nasdaq snaps 5-week win streak","<p>U.S. stocks closed mostly higher on Friday, but the three major indexes still posted their a round of weekly losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA added about 169 points, or 0.8%, ending near 33,869, while booking a 0.2% weekly decline, according to preliminary FactSet data. The S&amp;P 500 index SPX advanced 0.2% Friday and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP closed 0.6% lower. They fell 1.1% and 2.4% for the week, respectively. That snapped the rate-sensitive Nasdaq’s string of 5 straight weeks of gains, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Investor optimism around the Federal Reserve nearing the end of its rate hiking cycle helped push stocks higher to kick off the year, but bullishness has since eased with corporate earnings sagging and Fed officials warning that rates could stay high for some time. Despite the bite of higher interest rates, U.S. consumer sentiment data for February released on Friday signaled a cautious optimism about the economy. Another signal, the U.S. Treasury market yield curve, however, continued to warn about the potential for a U.S. recession, with the 2-year Treasury rate BX:TMUBMUSD02Y at about 4.5% on Friday and the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y at 3.7%, a deep inversion of the two rates that has often appeared before downturns in the past.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Fed funds futures, a derivative product that traders use to place bets on fluctuations in the Fed’s policy rate, were pricing in 74.3% odds of a hike in May, a marginal increase from 72% a day earlier, according to the CME tool. Investors have been pricing in higher odds of additional Fed hikes following surprisingly strong readings on the state of the U.S. labor market and services sector earlier this month. The data have helped convince investors that the Fed would hike rates above 5% and keep them there until at least 2024. Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have repeatedly advised that the central bank is committed to keeping rates higher for longer, but markets had been reluctant to take the Fed at its word prior to the release of the data earlier this month. Furthermore, Fed funds futures are pricing in higher probability of another hike in June, with odds rising to 48.2% after Tuesday morning’s data, up from 36.1% a week ago.

HLF shares gained in after-hours trading Tuesday, after the company reported a strong earnings beat in its first quarter with a former chief executive back in charge. Herbalife reported fourth-quarter net income of $54.4 million, or 55 cents a share, on net sales of $1.18 billion, down from $1.32 billion in the holiday season a year ago. Adjusted earnings also declined from last year, to 53 cents a share from 57 cents a share, due to a charge from a loss for extinguishment of debt.

After a string of disappointing earnings results, Herbalife brought CEO Michael Johnson back three months ago, and withdrew guidance. “We anticipate the energy and engagement being generated at our in-person events will translate to improving metrics in 2023,” Johnson said in Tuesday’s announcement. Executives continued to avoid providing specific guidance in Tuesday’s report, though, stating that “the company will periodically reassess its ability to provide guidance when we believe future performance can be reasonably estimated.” Herbalife shares rose more than 7% in the extended session Tuesday, after closing with a 3.7% gain at $17.36.

2023-02-21 17:34:00,: Adidas long- and short-term credit ratings downgraded by S&P on concerns after Yeezy partnership ended,"<p>S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded its long- and short-term ratings on Adidas AG XE:ADSDE:ADS1ADDYY on Tuesday to A+/A-1 from A-/A-2, citing deteriorating credit metrics in the wave of the termination of its partnership with Kanye West’s Yeezy. The outlook is negative, meaning the credit agency may downgrade again in the medium term. The Yeezy deal accounted for about 5% of total sales in 2021 and was planned to account for 7% in 2022, the agency said in a statement. Adidas is also facing competitive pressures in the key Chinese market, which accounted for 15.5% of total sales in the nine months through Sept. 30, as well as shrinking consumer demand in Western countries.  “Under our base-case scenario, credit metrics will significantly deteriorate with 2022 S&amp;P Global Ratings-adjusted debt to EBITDA of close to 3.0x (up from 0.7x in 2021) while peaking at 4x-5x in 2023 due to the expected operating challenges in the company’s key markets, announced one-off costs, and the impact from the Yeezy partnership’s termination,” said the statement. “We then expect adjusted leverage to gradually improve toward 2.0x-2.5x over 2024-2025 on average.” Adidas ADRs were down 5%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-02-21 14:46:00,: WHO says independent panel of experts is evaluating evidence on new COVID variants to determine whether vaccines need to be updated,"<p>The World Health Organization said Tuesday its expert panel on COVID vaccine composition is currently evaluating evidence on new variants of the virus to determine whether vaccines need to be updated. Members of the agency’s Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition, an independent group of experts, outlined the process in a commentary in Nature Medicine journal, in which they agreed the vaccines  are still offering a high level of protection against severe disease caused by all of the variants, including omicron, which is dominant globally. “However, there has been continuous and substantial evolution of SARS-CoV-2 since the virus emerged, posing challenges to the ongoing public health response, including ensuring that vaccines continue to provide protection,” the authors wrote. As the virus continues to spread by community transmission, further evolution is possible and the trajectory and timeline of virus evolution is uncertain, they added. “The current approach to vaccine antigen composition may not be sustainable in the long term, given the length of time for vaccine development, the paucity of surveillance data globally and the regulatory requirements in different countries,” they wrote. “Enhanced mucosal immunity may improve protection against infection and transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the TAG-CO-VAC encourages vaccine development in this area.”</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA tumbled about 697 points, or 2.1%, ending near 33,129, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX fell 2% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP closed down 2.5%, according to preliminary FactSet data.

The selloff in risk assets came after several Federal Reserve speakers recently stressed the need to keep bringing stubbornly high inflation levels down toward the central bank’s 2% annual target.

That marked the biggest decline for any June-to-December period since the 2008, during the financial crisis, the real estate services company said. The housing market has been declining as rising mortgage rates have hurt demand. The hardest hit area was San Francisco, which saw the total value of homes in December fall by $37.3 billion, or 6.7%, from a year ago to $517.5 billion, while Miami saw the value of its homes surge by $77 billion, or 19.7%, in December to $468.5 billion. “The housing market has shed some of its value, but most homeowners will still reap big rewards from the pandemic housing boom,” said Redfin Economics Research Lead Chen Zhao. “The total value of U.S. homes remains roughly $13 trillion higher than it was in February 2020, the month before the coronavirus was declared a pandemic.” Redfin’s stock has soared 72.3% over the past three months but has still tumbled 64.8% over the past 12 months.

2023-02-22 12:24:00,: Genius Group launches legal action against various parties for illegal trading of its shares,"<p>Genius Group Ltd. GNS, a Singapore-based education company, said Wednesday it is launching legal action against various parties over illegal trading in its shares. The news comes after the company in January appointed a former F.B.I. director to lead a task force investigating alleged illegal trading in its stock that it first disclosed in early January. The company is concerned that it has been the target of naked short selling, which is illegal under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. In regular short trading, an investor borrows shares from someone else, then sells them and waits for the stock price to fall. When that happens the shares are bought cheaper and returned to the prior owner, with the short seller pocketing the difference as profit. In naked short selling, investors don’t bother borrowing the stock first and simply sell shares with a promise to deliver them at a later date. When that promise is not fulfilled, it’s known as failure to deliver. Genius CEO Roger Hamilton told MarketWatch in January that it wanted the activity, which had pressured its stock price, to stop. “They’re taking value away from our shareholders. They’re predators. They’re doing something illegal, and we want it to stop, whether that means getting regulators to enforce existing regulations or put new ones in place.” The company hired the legal teams of Christian Levine Law Group, LLC, and Warshaw Burstein, LLP, and share tracking company ShareIntel and has not instructed them to commence legal actions. “The company is currently pursuing a combination of negotiations, legal action and shareholder actions with an aim to minimize and recover the costs that illegal market manipulation has had on our share price,” Hamilton said in a Wednesday release.

Sales growth was driven by “inflation-justified” per unit price increases, which were partially offset by lower sales volume, mostly in the banana and fresh and value-added products segments, and the strong dollar. Banana sales rose 9% to $32.9 million, while fresh and value-added product sales fell 4% to $21.8 million, due to lower sales of avocados,  and non-tropical fruit, which was hurt by lower prices and lower volumes.

2023-03-03 17:30:00,: Oil dips after report U.A.E. internally debating leaving OPEC,"<p>Oil futures dipped Friday, then recovered, after a report by The Wall Street Journal detailing strained relations between Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. The report, citing Emirati officials, said U.A.E. is having an internal debate over leaving the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. U.A.E. leaders have talked of leaving OPEC for years without taking action, the report said, but recent disagreements with Saudi Arabia have rekindled interest. The most intense disagreement is over Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. led an intervention by an Arab military coalition in 2015, the report said. The countries also clashed behind the scenes last year, when OPEC+ — made up of the cartel and its Russia-led allies — agreed to substantially cut crude production over the objections of the Biden administration. While the U.A.E. publicly supported the cut, officials privately told their U.S. counterparts that they wanted to pump more, the report said. May Brent crude BRN00, the global benchmark, was up 72 cents, or 0.8%, at $85.47 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after falling as low as $82.51 immediately after the report.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-03-03 21:10:00,Market Extra: Inflation has yet to peak in most G-10 countries and ‘we are waiting for a proper market reality check’: BofA,"<p>Getty Images/iStockphoto“The inflation genie is still out of the bottle.”Those are the words of strategists Claudio Piron and Athanasios Vamvakidis at BofA Securities, who said on Friday that inflation has yet to peak in most Group-of-10 countries and that “we are waiting for a proper market reality check.”In an email to MarketWatch,  Vamvakidis, the London-based global head of G10 FX strategy, said the “reality check” refers to “all markets” and the need for “a proper risk-off, as the economy weakens but inflation is high and sticky.” He notes that in most G-10 economies, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has yet to start falling.For the most part, financial markets have been bifurcated across two lines of thinking — one in which inflation remains stubbornly high because of unexpected economic strength, and the other in which slowing growth and/or approaching recession helps cure the inflation problem by bringing down price pressures. BofA Securities raises a third, less-talked-about scenario in which inflation doesn’t end up easing as much as many expect, even when there’s economic weakness.  “The reality is that we thought inflation was peaking and maybe it hasn’t,” said Rob Daly, director of fixed income at Glenmede Investment Management in Philadelphia, who helps oversee more than $4 billion in institutional fixed-income strategies. “It’s certainly moderating, but it’s the pace of that moderation that matters. The markets have been slow to adjust to the reality of stickiness to inflation. There’s a level of uncertainty that is really capturing the market’s focus and that we have to put our hands around. Nobody knows where it’s going, especially central banks.”  Uncertainty over the most likely path of inflation and course of central-bank action has only increased this week. A steady stream of data out of the euro zone, Spain, France and the U.K. threw cold water on the idea of easing price pressures, while China’s manufacturing rebound looked better than expected. U.S. data is pointing to continued labor-market strength and economic resilience, while traders of derivatives-like instruments known as fixings expect the next major inflation update — the February U.S. consumer-price, released on March 14 — to reflect an annual headline rate of almost 6.1%, versus 6.4% in January.Yet on Thursday and Friday, financial markets clung to hopes that the Federal Reserve could pause its rate hikes this summer, spurred by comments made by Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who said he is firmly in the camp that supports quarter-of-a-percentage-point interest rate hikes. Bostic’s remarks helped power a rebound in U.S. stocks DJIA  SPXCOMP, which finished higher on Friday; contributed to a pullback in Treasury yields, and prompted traders to somewhat reduce their expectations for a half-of-a-percentage point Fed rate hike on March 22.With the stock and bond markets fluctuating this week between hopes for a Fed pause in interest rate rises and the higher-for-longer view on rates, the implications of persistent inflation on the around-the-clock currency market are mixed. While the still-hot U.S. labor market supports the dollar, rising euro-zone inflation and a data-dependent European Central Bank “should be positive for the EUR [euro],” Piron, an emerging Asia FI/FX strategist in Singapore, and Vamvakidis wrote in a note on Friday. BofA expects the EUR/USD EURUSD to trade at 1.10 by year-end versus 1.05 in the first quarter.Although the dollar is now close to their forecasts for the first half, “we do not believe the market had a proper reality check yet,” they said. “We will feel that this is the case only when both bad news and good news are bad news — the former because the Fed will have to keep hiking, the latter because the Fed cannot cut rates for as long as inflation remains high and sticky.”Meanwhile, a team at Deutsche Bank came out with multiple scenarios for Treasury yields through the end of this year. The team’s baseline scenario is for the policy-sensitive 2-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y to get to 4.65% and the 10-year BX:TMUBMUSD10Y to reach 4.15% during the first quarter. However, they haven’t ruled out some risk that the shorter-term yield could jump to 6.15%, and the 10-year could reach 4.9%, by the end of this month under a “higher for longer scenario,” up from 4.86% and 3.96% respectively on Friday. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The S&amp;P 500 index SPX rose about 1.6% on Friday, its best daily percentage gain since Jan. 20, according to FactSet data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA gained 1.2%, or about 386 points, ending near 33,386, based on preliminary figures. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP rose 2%.

The move comes amid fears Russia is funneling imports through countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, China and Uzbekistan to fuel its war on Ukraine. “Those who attempt to prop up Putin’s war machine by evading our export controls and sanctions will be held accountable,” said Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary of commerce for export enforcement, in a statement cited by the paper. The three U.S. agencies have issued a “compliance note” on the “use of third-party intermediaries or transshipment points to evade Russian- and Belarussian-related sanctions and export controls.”</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Nexletol was granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February of 2020, but sales have been less than stellar.  The company posted $18.8 million in total sales in the fourth quarter of 2022, below the $20.0 million FactSet consensus.

The Chinese government on Sunday set this year’s economic growth target at around 5%.

Saudi Aramco raised the official selling price for Arab light crude oil for Asia and if “Saudi Arabia feels confident enough to raise prices to China, they must feel pretty good about the demand growth expectations,” said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at The Price Futures Group.

2023-03-06 17:15:00,Market Extra: Pair of Wall Street firms see Friday’s job data coming in way above consensus,"<p>Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesFriday’s nonfarm payrolls report for February is likely to come in way above  consensus estimates, reinforcing the trend seen in January’s data, according to a pair of Wall Street firms.Economists at Deutsche Bank DB expect to see a job gain of 300,000, citing February’s mild weather as one likely influence. Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons, economists at Jefferies JEF, said they foresee a gain of 290,000 for last month. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, on average, expect February payrolls to have grown by 225,000.A stronger-than-expected jobs report has the potential to trigger another round of repricing in financial markets similar to the one seen after January’s nonfarm payroll report. As of Monday afternoon, a day before the start of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s semiannual testimony to Congress, all three major U.S. stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP were moving higher, while Treasury yields were little changed.“February’s jobs data probably has more of an ability to move markets than January’s report because there’s very heightened sensitivity to any suggestion of the economy overheating,” said Will Compernolle, a macro strategist at FHN Financial in New York. “January’s data was really hot, but because of seasonal-adjustment issues, markets are still clinging on to the  hope that it was a bit of a fluke. If it’s a really above-consensus jobs report, that will be under the magnifying glass much more so than if it is below consensus, in which case markets would look past it as insufficient comfort.”Read: Why the February jobs report is unlikely to reverse a January blowout in this week’s key economic data releaseThe 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10, a benchmark rate for everything from mortgages to student and automobile loans, hovered around 3.96% Monday, down from an intraday high of 4.08% reached last week.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The stock initially sank as much as 5.8% at an all-time intraday low of $6.29, then rocketed 31.1% off that low to an intraday high of $8.25 before paring some gains. The company said net income of rose to $24.8 million from about $324,000, to beat the FactSet consensus of $18.1 million, while revenue grew 6.2% to $165.0 million to top expectations of $154.5 million. Chief Executive Stan Chia said on the post-earnings conference call with analysts, according to AlphaSense, that Vivid was seeing the “highest repeat rates that we’ve ever seen amongst our customers,” which provides a boost to margins, and the repeat rates continue to trend higher. That outlook helped offset 2023 revenue guidance of $580 million to $610 million, which was below the FactSet consensus of $615.1 million at the time of the report. D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte reiterated his buy rating on the stock, saying Vivid is the best positioned of the companies he covers to “exploit the reopening trade, with more consumers returning to various live events in 2022.” The stock was still down 3.1% over the past three months while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has gained 1.2%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The FactSet consensus for earnings per share was 47 cents. Sales grew 4.2% to $1.08 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $1.02 billion. For the first three quarters of the fiscal year, Jack Daniel’s sales rose 5%, as higher pricing offset lower volumes, while sales of premium bourbons jumped 33% and tequila sales increased 12%. “The rebuilding of finished goods inventories, due to the easing of supply chain constraints, positively impacted results during the first nine months of fiscal 2023,” the company said in a statement. The stock has lost 2.7% over the past three months through Tuesday, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has edged up 0.6%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-03-08 13:14:00,: Odeon downgrades Bank of America on outlook for weaker consumer spending,"<p>Bank of America Corp. BAC stock dipped 0.2% in premarket trade after falling more than 3% in the regular session on Tuesday. Odeon Capital downgraded the megabank to hold from buy, with a target price of $35.20 a share. Analyst Richard Bove said Bank of America’s business will slow down as the U.S. heads into a potential recession and consumers tap the brakes on spending. “The company is a strong consumer lender,” Bove said. “Yet it is likely that home mortgage growth will weaken. The industry data is not good at the moment.” Bove said the likelihood is “high” that Bank of America’s cost of funds will rise more quickly than interest rates overall. Bank of America stock is down about 0.4% in 2023 after Tuesday’s sell-off eliminated its gains for the year.

BBBY said Wednesday it has received about $135 million in gross proceeds from the exercise of preferred stock warrants that were issued as part of a public equity offering conducted on Feb. 7.

Proceeds have been used to repay outstanding revolving loans, “creating additional liquidity opportunities to support business operating activities,” it said in a Wednesday release. The news comes after the troubled retailer said last week it had made the interest payments on senior notes that were due Feb. 1.  “Since closing our equity financing last month, we have engaged with suppliers to improve our inventory positioning and we have continued to optimize our brick-and-mortar footprint through store closures to align with customer preference,” CEO Sue Gove said in the release.

By comparison deposits from funds and early stage companies comprised 52% of Silicon Valley Bank’s balance sheet, Najarian said.  First Republic’s available for sale securities (AFS) portfolio is 1.7% of earning assets, versus 14% for SIVB before liquidation. “FRC has historically thrived in periods of disruption, given its well-earned reputation as a ‘quality’ bank,” Najarian said. “While the bank has grown much since, one of FRC’s most banner origination years was during the depths of the Global Financial Crisis.” First Republic stock is down 0.9% after steeper losses earlier on Friday. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-03-10 13:09:00,: SVB Financial stock slides 66% premarket as fears of a potential run on the bank continue,"<p>SVB Financial Group SIVB, the parent of Silicon Valley Bank, saw its stock tumble more than 66% in premarket trade Friday, in a continued response to reports late Thursday that several funds were advising clients to pull their money, sparking fears of a run on the bank. Bloomberg News late Thursday reported that Founders Fund, the San Francisco-based venture-capital fund co-founded by Peter Thiel, has advised companies to do just so. The report cited people familiar with the matter.  It came after SVB Financial ended down a record 60% in the regular trading day after disclosing large losses from securities sales and announcing a dilutive stock offering along with a profit warning.

2023-03-13 11:58:00,: Charles Schwab moves to reassure investors it has plenty of liquidity and business is performing ‘exceptionally well’,"<p>Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW moved Monday to reassure investors that it has plenty of liquidity and does not need to sell any of its held-to-maturity securities over unrealized losses. Chief Financial Officer Peter Crawford said the business is performing “exceptionally well” and that it expects first-quarter revenue to grow 10% from a year ago.  The company has an estimated $100 billion of cash flow and upwards of $8 billion in potential retail CD issuances a month.  The company’s approach to managing its assets is different to traditional banks, he said. “As a reminder, our banks’ loan-to-deposit ratio is approximately 10% and nearly all the loans are over-collateralized by first-lien mortgages or securities. The remainder of our assets are invested in high-quality, liquid securities in either our available-for-sale (AFS) portfolio, working capital at the parent or  broker-dealer subsidiaries, or in our HTM portfolio.” Focusing attention on HTM’s unrealized losses is flawed, as the company has no need to sell assets before they mature. “Second, by looking at unrealized losses among HTM securities, but not doing the same for traditional banks’ loan portfolios, the analysis penalizes firms like Schwab that in fact have a higher quality, more liquid, and more transparent balance sheet,” he added. The  statement came after the stock was swept up in the carnage in the banking sector late last week amid the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

SCHW was lifted to buy from neutral on Monday by Citigroup analysts, who see a a “compelling entry point” from a 23% drop over two days. Shares of the financial services company, down 7% in premarket trading, have been hit by fallout from the failure of Silicon Valley Bank. “We see near-term revenue/earnings headwinds from rising funding costs and continued client cash sorting, but we believe these are reflected in the current stock price. While client cash sorting is a pressure point and we expect to see the magnitude at a higher level than prior cycles, we do not see a material risk to deposits leaving SCHW given the composition of its deposit base and customer protections ($750K in insurance given 3 bank charters),” said Citi analysts Christopher Allen and Alessandro Balbo. They noted that Schwab pointed to $100-$150 billion in funding capacity from supplemental liquidity sources — retail CD’s, Federal Home Loan Banks advances and wholesale funding/repos. It had borrowed $17.1 billion from external debt facilities and $6.05 billion from retail brokered CD’s by end 2022, while from year-end through Feb., it borrowed an extra $16.4 billion from external debt facilities and $9.4 billion in additional brokered CD’s. The company assured that these moves were temporary, said Citi. The analysts cut their price target to $75 per share from $84, still a multiple of 14 times their 2024 earnings per share. Citi analysts said they still prefer brokers with lower levels of client cash/sorting deposit risk, such as Interactive Brokers Group [s: ibkr] and LPL Financial Holdings [s: lpla]. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Investors were weighing the fallout of last week’s collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, after regulators on Sunday moved to make all depositors whole and avert a repeat of the bank run that brought down the institution. Regulators also made depositors at Signature Bank whole, after the New York-based institution was closed down on Sunday. Fed-funds futures reflected a 31.4% chance the Fed leaves its benchmark rate unchanged at 4.5% to 4.75% at the end of its next meeting, and a 68.6% chance of a 25 basis point, or quarter of a percentage point, rise, according to the CME FedWatch tool. That’s a big turnabout from last week, when traders had briefly priced in a better-than-70% chance of a half-point increase. Economists at Goldman Sachs, in a note late Sunday, predicted the Fed would leave rates unchanged at the March meeting due to worries about stress in the banking system. They left unchanged their expectation that the Fed will deliver 25 basis point rate hikes in May, June and Julyl, lifting the fed-funds rate to a peak of 5.25%-5.5%, while noting they “see considerable uncertainty about the path.”</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

However, JetBlue’s “[s]trong performance on revenue and execution on costs are largely being offset by an increase in fuel prices, which is primarily driven by volatility in regional jet fuel prices,” the company continued. The company currently estimates that fuel price per gallon, net of hedges, will be $3.50 to $3.60 for the first quarter. JetBlue previously was forecasting $3.20 to $3.35.

2023-03-14 10:16:00,": Spirit Airlines raises outlook for Q1 operating costs, sees capacity about a half percentage point lower than prior guidance","<p>Spirit Airlines Inc. SAVE said Tuesday it now expects its fiscal first quarter operating expenses to range from $1.45 billion to $1.47 billion, some $60 million to $70 million higher than previous guidance. The carrier said that’s mostly due to higher fuel costs and the implementation of a new pilot contract. The company expects first-quarter capacity to be about a half percentage point lower than previously expected, most due to an increase in the number of unscheduled engine removals during the quarter, resulting in fewer flights. ‘Pratt & Whitney has indicated supply chain issues are beginning to improve and we should see less impact from unscheduled events as we move throughout the year. As such, we expect to see a steady increase in fleet utilization, reaching normalized utilization levels by the end of the year,” said Ted Christie, Spirit’s chief executive officer, in a regulatory filing. The company is still expecting to be profitable in the second, third and fourth quarters and for all of 2023, he said. The Justice Department last week sued to block JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU from buying Spirit Airlines Inc., saying the plan would eliminate competition and stick travelers with higher air fares.

Lennar shares rose 3% after hours, following a 1.3% rise in the regular session to close at $100.77. The company reported fiscal first-quarter net income of $596.5 million, or $2.06 a share, compared with $503.6 million, or $1.69 a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose to $6.49 billion from $6.2 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast $1.55 a share on revenue of $5.91 billion. “During the quarter, we saw a generally strong economy at the intersection of high inflation and strong employment numbers, while the housing market continued down a winding road of trying to find its footing,” said Stuart Miller, Lennar chairman, in a statement. “In December, interest rates and sticker shock continued to constrain sales activity, while in January and early February, lower interest rates energized sales. In late February, a spike in interest rates impacted website and community traffic and had a slight impact on sales.” Home deliveries rose 9% from a year ago to 13,659, while analysts were forecasting 12,569.

2023-03-14 19:38:00,"Market Extra: Government bonds held at banks may be so-called ‘toxic asset’ of next financial crisis, fund manager says","<p>Contagion fears triggered by the speedy collapse of two regional banks in less than a week is raising the risk of a crisis in confidence in U.S. banks, one in which government bonds would be the “toxic asset” at the center of it all.That’s one of two scenarios being entertained by European global investment manager Eric Sturdza Investments, which managed $1.3 billion across eight funds as of January. Under a best-case scenario, investors’ fears would be calmed as California’s Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in New York are reorganized “in an orderly fashion,” according to Chris Crawford, the Boston-based portfolio manager of the firm’s Strategic Long Short Fund. The flip-side scenario is that the U.S. government’s weekend efforts to ensure that the banks’ depositors are made whole may erode confidence even further, with consumers starting to fear for the safety of their deposits, he said.Financial-stability concerns are running up against the Federal Reserve’s need to keeping hiking interest rates, particularly with inflation still running strong as reflected in Tuesday’s CPI report for February. With investors continuing to assess the risks of further fallout from the banks’ collapse — a consequence of the Federal Reserve’s yearlong rate-hike campaign —analysts like Vicky Redwood, a senior economic adviser for Capital Economics, point to some possibility that the start of the next financial crisis could already be under way.At the core of the banking sector’s problems is a mismatch between assets and liabilities, which was blamed for Silicon Valley Bank’s failure but isn’t likely to be contained to just a small circle of banks. Deposit growth has outstripped bank lending over the past few years, forcing banks to place more capital in the perceived safety of medium and long-duration Treasurys, without realizing higher inflation and interest rates would one day erode the value of those bonds. Even if banks could avoid marking down the value of their balance sheets or have sufficient capital to absorb write-downs, contagion fears could lead to “self-fulfilling action” that prompts customers to pull more of their deposits, according to Crawford. The fund manager couldn’t immediately be reached for further comment.“It is rather notable that toxic loans (e.g. NINJA loans) were the problem in the GFC [2007-2008 Great Financial Crisis], whereas the ‘toxic’ asset in the [next] crisis would be government bonds!” Crawford wrote in a note on Tuesday. In a scenario in which trust in banks is broken, “ever greater government measures (and funding) will be required to backstop more individual banks and/or provide much larger general platforms to backstop all banks,” Crawford said. Mass-scale intervention “could imply massive creation of new money which is inflationary, but it could also spark a severe recession via a collapse in consumer confidence and hiring, which is deflationary.” The Fed’s interest-rate policy might be impacted “with less inclination to raise rates in a skittish environment, which could actually favor riskier assets and the hyper-growth/leveraged equities that have underperformed so severely in the past few quarters…  It is also conceivable that inflation could continue to be a problem even with a weakening economy or recession,” producing an environment of stagflation, Crawford said. Banks are one of the most prominent players in the financial market with a need to put capital in a safe place. That’s because they generally lend over the longer term, while relying on deposits that can theoretically be withdrawn in a single day — creating a “duration mismatch,” according to Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. This mismatch becomes a problem when the bank is holding longer-term Treasurys and needs to sell them at a loss, well before maturity.Absent the banking-sector’s woes, Tuesday’s CPI data should have left the Federal Reserve on a path of hiking rates again next week by a half-percentage point, according to Neil Dutta of Renaissance Macro Research. Instead, fed-funds futures traders were factoring in a 77.5% chance of a quarter-point hike that would take the Fed’s main benchmark rate target to between 4.75% and 5% on March 22. Meanwhile, Treasury yields spiked across the board on Tuesday, handing the policy-sensitive 2-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD02Y its biggest one-day jump since Feb. 3. All three major U.S. stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP finished higher, as investors focused on the brighter side of the CPI report, which matched estimates. Shares of regional banks rebounded.On Monday, Colorado-based portfolio manager Brian Mulberry of Zacks Investment Management, which manages $15 billion in assets, said that the common thread facing most, if not all, U.S. banks centers on the way they may have managed interest-rate risks, leaving them in trouble “should a large-scale run develop.” </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The three-member appeals court ruled two to one that most of Proposition 22, the law that came out of a 2020 ballot initiative on which the companies spent more than $200 million, could be upheld after a judge last year declared it unconstitutional. But the ruling severed one provision of the law, leaving open the possibility that workers could win the right to collectively bargain — which is being considered in places like Massachusetts. Uber saw its shares rise almost 5% to close at $32.34. DoorDash stock increased nearly 6% to close at $56.95.

The consumer, industrial and healthcare products company’s stock was up as much as 1.6% at its intraday high of $105.17, but was shedding 1.8% in afternoon trading. Chief Financial Officer Monish Patolawala is scheduled to speak early Wednesday at the J.P.

2023-03-14 17:03:00,: First Republic Bank’s A-minus credit on review for possible downgrade by S&P over concerns about volatile deposit flows,"<p>First Republic Bank’s FRC A-minus rating was placed on review for a possible downgrade by S&amp;P Global Ratings on Tuesday, with the agency concerned about volatile deposit flows in the wake of the government’s closure of two banks in the last week.  “Consequently, we expect the bank to increase wholesale borrowings to shore up its on-balance-sheet liquidity, which would likely weigh on its already modest profitability,” the agency said in a statement. S&amp;P has placed the credit on CreditWatch Negative, with the latter reflecting the potential for its funding profile, revenue stability and profitability to deteriorate. While recent actions by federal regulators should improve bank access to liquidity, S&amp;P is concerned that First Republic’s deposit levels may be volatile because it has a more concentrated deposit base, requiring increased use of more costly contingent liquidity. The bank said Sunday it has over $70 billion in contingent liquidity after a deal with JP Morgan Chase & Co. JPM and the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program. “First Republic’s already modest profitability due to its loan portfolio being heavily weighted toward long-duration residential mortgages–which have fallen in fair value as interest rates have rapidly increased–may be hurt by the higher costs associated with the incremental wholesale funding,” said the statement. The bank’s stock was up 37% Tuesday in a partial rebound from selling in the past several days. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-03-15 11:22:00,: Nouriel Roubini says Credit Suisse collapse would be like a Lehman moment,"<p>Nouriel Roubini, the high-profile economist and chief economist of Roubini Macro Associated, said on Wednesday that a Credit Suisse failure would be like a “Lehman Brothers moment.” Roubini in an interview on Bloomberg Television said the problem with Credit Suisse, which dropped over 20% to a fresh record low, is that it may be too big to fail but also could be too big to be saved, citing the smaller capacity of Switzerland. Under Swiss rules, Credit Suisse would see its bonds converted into equity in a “bail-in” process. Investors seeking safety should go to short-term bonds, TIPS, gold and other precious metals, he said.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

That’s at least on paper, based on their mark-to-market positions. It comes after the collapse of three banks in the last week — Silicon Valley Bank SIVB, Signature Bank SBNY and Silvergate Capital — which have sent the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking Sector ETFKRE down 23% from March 8 through March 13. Both Silicon Valley Bank parent SVB Financial Group and Signature Bank are in the top 20 most shorted stocks in the regional banking sector. The most shorted stock is PNC Financial Services PNC.  “We have seen increased short selling in the sector over the last seven days with $416 million of new short selling partially offsetting a $3.9 billion decline in the stock prices of shares shorted,” S3 wrote in commentary. For now, with SIVB and SBNY halted, shorts are left paying daily stock borrow financing rates and the short positions will remain open until the Nasdaq and DTC determine they are delisted and worthless, said S3, “providing for technical close outs of long and short positions or the short seller’s Prime Broker locates an OTC trade with a long shareholder.

Sterling Bancorp is the holding company for wholly owned subsidiary Sterling Bank and Trust F.S.B., with branches in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, and Southfield, Michigan. “For years, Sterling originated residential mortgages that were rife with fraud to pad its bottom line and then lied about these loans in its IPO and subsequent public filings, defrauding unwitting investors,” the DOJ said. Under the terms of the plea agreement, which must be accepted by the court, the company will plead guilty to one count of securities fraud, serve probation through 2026, submit to enhanced reporting obligations to the department, and pay more than $27.2 million in restitution to shareholders.

2023-03-15 19:05:00,"Market Extra: Credit Suisse fallout upsets Fed rate-hike expectations, with full percentage point of cuts seen by year-end","<p>Fabrice Coffrini/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesContagion fears triggered by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, then exacerbated by trouble at Switzerland’s Credit Suisse, is giving way to fresh expectations for at least 100 basis points, or a full percentage point, of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve before the end of the year. Traders are pricing in a 41.9% chance that the fed funds rate target will drop to between 3.5% and 3.75%, or even lower, by December, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. That would be down from a current target of 4.5% and 4.75%, implying at least 100 basis points of rate cuts by the Fed’s final meeting of 2023. It marks a sharp turnabout from a week ago, when traders saw a decent chance of rates heading toward 6% this year and staying there.Behind the repricing of expectations is concern that contagion fears might not be contained to just a few banks, after the top shareholder of Credit Suisse CS told Bloomberg that it wouldn’t raise its stake in the Swiss bank. Just last week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell pointed to the possible need to reaccelerate the pace of rate hikes, though he said policy makers hadn’t yet made a decision about their next meeting on March 22. Traders now see a 50.5% chance of a pause next week, and 49.5% likelihood of a quarter-point move.“Credit Suisse is in focus at the moment as the bank’s shares dropped to a fresh all-time low (declining more than 20%) and jitters reverberate throughout the European banking sector,” said BMO Capital Markets strategists Ian Lyngen and Ben Jeffery. “Renewed investor concern regarding precisely how contained the lender stress will ultimately be will continue to drive the performance of risk assets, and Treasuries have benefited from the resumption of flight-to-quality flows,” which triggered a plunge in yields on Wednesday.Treasury yields plunged in New York trading, with the policy-sensitive 2-year rate  BX:TMUBMUSD02Y falling 24.8 basis points to an almost six-month low of 3.973%.

2023-03-16 16:19:00,: Group of licensed medical cannabis operators file suit against New York regulator for failing to open licensing to all applicants at the same time,"<p>A coalition of licensed medical cannabis operators has filed a lawsuit against the New York cannabis regulator, alleging it overstepped its authority and subverted the intent of the state legislature by failing to comply with provisions of the 2021 Marihuana Regulation and Taxation Act, or MRTA. The Cannabis Control Board and Office of Cannabis Management “established policies that undermine the MRTA’s laudable social equity goals and hinder licensed operators from entering the market. These policies have delayed the availability of safe, regulated cannabis products for medical patients and adult-use consumers in New York State,” the Coalition for Access to Regulated & Safe Cannabis said in a statement. The group argues that the MRTA required that the OCM And CCB open the initial adult-use retail dispensary license application period to all candidates at the same time. But instead, they created a program called the Conditional Adult-Use Retail Dispensary (CAURD) program that effectively created a new license class and allowed that group access before others.  The CAURD program was announced last March with the intention of granting the first licenses to individuals who had prior cannabis-related convictions that occurred in New York state.  But some applicants have challenged the program arguing it conflicts with the US Dormant Commerce Clause, which blocks states from discriminating against interstate commerce. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The company saw fourth-quarter net income of $659.1 million, or $2.96 a share, up from $597.4 million, or $2.57 a share, in the year-earlier period. Analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting $2.95 a share. Dollar General generated net sales of $10.2 billion in the quarter, up from $8.7 billion a year prior and in line with the FactSet consensus. The increase was largely fueled by same-store sales growth and contributions from new stores, though some store closures weighed on overall growth. Same-store sales were up 5.7% in the quarter, while analysts were modeling 5.8% growth. For fiscal 2023, Dollar General expects 3.0% to 3.5% growth in same-store sales. Analysts were modeling 3.4% growth. The company also expects that it will see roughly 5.5% to 6.0% growth in net sales, including an anticipated two-point negative impact related to the fact that fiscal 2022 had 53 weeks. Analysts tracked by FactSet were modeling $40.0 billion in net sales for the fiscal year, up about 5.8% from the $37.8 billion in net sales that Dollar General reported Thursday for fiscal 2022. “Our fiscal 2023 full-year outlook reflects our confidence in the business, even in a potentially challenging economic and operating environment,” Chief Financial Officer John Garratt said in a release. “While we anticipate the first half of fiscal 2023 to be negatively impacted by ongoing sales mix pressures, higher shrink levels, increased damages, and higher interest expense, we are confident in our full-year plans.” The company noted in its release that the board of directors declared an increase of the dividend to 59 cents a share. Dollar General was previously paying 55 cents a share. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The rating agency affirmed UBS’ A- issuer credit rating. The move comes after UBS  agreed to take over Credit Suisse on Sunday in a move brokered by the Swiss government and central bank. “We believe that UBS’ management will prudently execute the CS integration and, due to the very high financial buffers resulting from the transaction and massive liquidity support from the Swiss central bank, we see sufficient buffers to limit emerging risks effectively,” S&amp;P said in a statement. However, given the size and weaker credit profile of Credit Suisse and the complexity in winding down a large part of its investment banking operations, there is a risk that the combined group will see a weakening of its competitive position or will miss financial targets due to restructuring or litigation costs that could be substantial. “In our base case, we already anticipate client churn at the combined entity, particularly in wealth management and Swiss banking, where both entities have significant client overlaps,” said the agency. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-03-21 19:20:00,The Tell: Goldman Sachs warns of broad-based deterioration in market functioning,"<p>Ozan Kose/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesRecent stress in the banking sector isn’t the only sign that something is breaking or about to crack in the wake of the Federal Reserve’s yearlong rate-hike campaign.On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs GS warned that it’s seeing signs of a broad-based deterioration in market functioning and a “material uptick” in most of the indicators it follows to gauge market impairment across assets. “A closer look reveals much of the stress to be stemming from the Treasury and funding markets,” said Ravi Raj, a rates strategist and quantitative economist at the firm.Out of almost three dozen indicators, seven were in a red zone as of Monday and in the highest percentile of the firm’s “Temperature Check” chart, meaning they show the most signs of impairment or stress relative to the past five years, Raj said in an email to MarketWatch. Those red-hot readings include the UST Bloomberg Liquidity Index and the 10-year security’s market depth, which refers to the market’s ability to absorb large orders without significantly impacting the underlying price.Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchTuesday’s warning from Goldman Sachs came on a day in which investors seemed willing to look past the banking sector’s problems, for now. As financial markets turned to Wednesday’s policy update from the Fed, Treasury yields shot higher across the board, sending the 2-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD02Y to its biggest one-day jump since June 5, 2009. Meanwhile, U.S. stocks DJIASPXCOMP finished higher. Last year, traders, academics and other analysts raised concerns that the Treasury market was fragile, potentially even vulnerable to becoming the source of the next financial crisis, should there be large-scale forced selling or some other surprise.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-03-21 19:02:00,": S&P 500 reclaims 4,000 mark, stocks end higher ahead of Fed rate decision","<p>The S&amp;P 500 on Tuesday posted its highest close since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month, which sent shockwaves through financial markets and raised concerns about the stability of the U.S. banking system. The  S&amp;P 500 index SPX closed up about 51 points, or 1.3%, ending near 4,003, according to preliminary data from FactSet. That was its highest close since May 6, four days before the failure of Silicon Valley, the biggest bank collapse since the 2008 global financial crisis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 1% Tuesday, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP swept to a 1.6% gain. Banks and companies with heavy exposure to rate-sensitive assets, including property loans, have been under pressure since Silicon Valley Bank’s implosion. It drew attention to some $600 billion in paper losses at banks from their holdings of “safe” but low-coupon securities that have fallen in value in the year since the Federal Reserve began rapidly increasing interest rates to combat high inflation. Those older bonds end up worth less when investors have access to new securities with higher yields, with a similar low-risk profile in terms of credit risks. The failure of several regional banks in March, plus the sale of Credit Suisse CS to rival bank UBS UBS over the weekend, has reawakened fears of potentially broader problems in the banking system as central bank have increased rates and ended an era of easy money. Even so, stocks were rallying as the Federal Reserve at the conclusion of its 2-day policy meeting on Wednesday is expected to raise its policy rate by another 25 basis points.

With about 8 million shares trading hands, it’s the most active stock in the premarket.

Options on the table include a sale, a capital infusion and asset sales, the sources said, according to the Journal. The outcome of today’s Fed meeting is unclear following the dramatic events of the past 10 days, which has seen the failure of Silicon Valley Bank amid a run on the bank’s deposits, along with the failures of two crypto-friendly lenders, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital. Adding to the tension is the forced shotgun wedding of Credit Suisse and UBS in Switzerland last weekend.

2023-03-22 19:55:00,: Fitch downgrades First Republic Bank again on ‘costly’ funding profile,"<p>Fitch Ratings late Wednesday downgraded First Republic Bank’s FRC debt rating three notches, following a downgrade last week. Fitch downgraded the bank’s issuer default rating to “B” from “BB.” The downgrade comes after a group of banks injected $30 billion of liquidity into the bank. “While this injection created necessary headroom from a liquidity perspective, the bank’s new funding profile is relatively costly and is viewed as the primary ratings constraint,” Fitch said. “Fitch estimates that, due to the higher cost of funds, FRC is currently operating at a net loss that is not sustainable over the longer term absent a balance sheet restructuring,” the ratings agency said. “Furthermore, to the extent that FRC is required to repay the $30 billion at the end of its term, it will have to raise liquidity by selling assets.”</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-03-23 06:40:00,: Swiss regulator says full writedown of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds due to ‘viability event’,"<p>Swiss regulator FINMA on Thursday defended the decision for Credit Suisse AG.’s CSCH:CSGN  additional Tier 1 bonds (AT1), or contingent convertible bonds or CoCos, to be written down as part of the investment bank’s merger with UBS AG UBSCH:UBSG. “The AT1 instruments issued by Credit Suisse provide contractually that they are written off in full in the event of a trigger event (viability event), in particular when extraordinary government support is granted,” the regulator said in a statement. As the bank was granted assistance loans backed by a federal default guarantee on March 19, the regulator instructed the bank to write down the 16 biillion francs ($17.2 billion) worth of those bonds to zero, it said. “On Sunday, a solution was found to protect customers, the financial center and the markets. In this context, it is important that CS’s banking business continues to function smoothly and without interruption. That is now the case,” said FINMA Director Urban Angehrn. FINMA explained that AT1 instruments in Switzerland are designed to be written off or converted into Common Equity Tier 1 capital before the equity of the bank in question is completely used up or written off. Those instruments publicly issued by big banks are mostly held by institutional investors due to their risk and large denominations, it added. The news of the writedown delivered a shock to investors of the $275 billion AT1 bond market, triggering a sell-off of other European bank debt earlier this week.

Stocks closed sharply lower Wednesday after the Fed raised its policy rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%, up a year ago from close to zero.

While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell pushed back on market expectations of a rate cut this year, the market focused on the Fed’s “less hawkish” adjustment to the statement: the removal of “ongoing increases” from the text of the statement, said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index. That suggested the central bank is “nearing the end of the hiking cycle.” Gold for April delivery GCJ23rose $46.30, or 2.4%, to settle at $1,995.90 an ounce on Comex.

BA employees allegedly worked on current and future Air Force One planes without the required security credentials, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Pentagon officials are scrutinizing the security lapse, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter. The company and the Defense Department also have been examining for how long many workers with access to the jets lacked certain credentials, and why in some cases security clearances had expired months or years ago, the report said. The Wall Street Journal quoted an Air Force spokeswoman as saying both the Air Force and Boeing are looking into what was described as a lapse in personnel tracking and “continue to provide robust security for the presidential jets.” Boeing said that it “quickly notified the Air Force after it discovered what it described as an administrative issue,” the report said. Air Force Ones are a variant of the famous 747 “Queen of the Skies” Boeing jet, which the company recently retired. The current iteration is a specially configured 747-200B, the newest and largest presidential airplane, Boeing has said.

They lowered their rating on Carvana’s debt to CC, from CCC+, with a negative outlook. The outlook “reflects our expectation that we will lower our issuer credit rating on the company to ‘D’ (default) upon the completion of the proposed exchange offer,” S&amp;P said. “Shortly after restructuring, we would raise the ratings to a level that reflects the ongoing risk of a conventional default or future distressed restructurings.” Carvana is pursuing the deal because its capital structure “is unsustainable and the company has limited options to reduce its debt burden and improve its cash flow organically,” S&amp;P said. The car retailer on Wednesday updated its fiscal first-quarter guidance and launched a bond swap of up to $1 billion to stave off its cash burn. The swap reportedly lacks support from the majority of the bondholders. Carvana stock is down 94% in the past 12 months, compared with a decline of around 10% for the S&amp;P 500 index.

2023-03-24 09:55:00,: Citi analyst sees ‘ample’ liquidity in banks to cover deposit withdrawals,"<p>Regions Financial Corp. RF, KeyCorp KEY and Fifth Third Bancorp FITB top a list of nine regional banks as measured by total available liquidity to cover potential deposit outflows,  Citi banking analyst Keith Horowitz said in a research note on Thursday. Regions currently has about 145% of available liquidity to cover its uninsured deposits, followed by 136% for KeyCorp and 134% for Fifth Third Bancorp. Comerica CMA ranks at the bottom of the list with 96% coverage of its uninsured deposits; also U.S. Bancorp USB with 98% and Citizens Financial Group Inc. CFG with 108%. “We recognize that funding the balance sheet with wholesale funding would present a material earnings headwind, but the purpose of this exercise is to show that sufficient liquidity is available even in the case of significant deposit outflow,” Horowitz said. Debt levels reported by the Federal Home Loan Bank, which provides extra debt to bank, has leveled off, which “suggests either banks’ demand for immediate funding has cooled, or they are turning to other facilities,” Horowitz said. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index BKX is down 22.6% so far in 2023 as the March 10 failure of Silicon Valley Bank has impacted the sector, compared to a 2.8% year-to-date increase by the S&amp;P 500 SPX.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose about 132 points, or 0.4%, ending near 32,238, Friday, boosting its weekly gain to 1.2%, according to preliminary FactSet data. The S&amp;P 500 index SPX climbed 0.6% Friday and 1.4% for the week, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP closed up 0.3% for a 1.7% weekly gain. Investors have been concerned about a potential credit crunch and its likely toll on the economy, after the failure earlier in March of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday said he expected credit conditions to tightening further, doing some of the central bank’s work for it, in terms of bringing down inflation. One worry is that high rates and tighter credit could lead to a wave of defaults. Goldman Sachs this week raised its default forecast for the U.S. high-yield, or junk-bond, market to 4% from 2.8% for 2023. The junk-bond market is considered an earlier harbinger of potential stress in credit markets since it finances companies already considered at an elevated risk of buckling. European banks also were in focus, including on Friday as shares of Deutsche Bank DB came under pressure after costs of insuring it against a credit default jumped. Still, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq posted back-to-back weekly gains, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Icahn spoke to the newspaper after launching a proxy campaign earlier in March and nominating three people to the company’s board, as disclosed in a letter to shareholders that focused on the company’s acquisition of Grail, a cancer screening company.

2023-03-29 18:39:00,: U.S. Bancorp annual report contained typo that undervalued the carrying amount of its loan book: WSJ,"<p>A typo in U.S. Bancorp USB annual report incorrectly states that their loan portfolio was undervalued by $51 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. A bank spokesperson said the correct figure for the carrying amount of its loan portfolio should have been $381.3 billion, not $318.3 billion as shown in the report. The correct figures indicate that the fair market value of the loans of $368.9 billion was $12.4 billion less than the carrying amount of the loan portfolio, a bank spokesman told the WSJ. The spokesperson said the typo did not get picked up in other figures in the report or create any other mistakes in the document. The carrying value, or book value, of an asset represents the value on a bank’s balance sheet, while the fair value is determined by the market and may fluctuate, according to Investopedia. The carrying value takes the cost of the asset and subtracts its depreciation over time.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The FTC’s release said that Illumina “is currently, and for the reasonably near future, will remain the only viable supplier of a critical input: NSG platforms necessary for MCED tests.” The company could “easily foreclose GRAIL’s competitors by raising their costs or withholding or degrading access to supply, service, or new technologies—inputs on which MCED test developers rely,” the release continued. The order reverses an administrative law judge’s initial decision on the matter. “Following the FTC Chief Administrative Law Judge’s (ALJ) decision in favor of Illumina in September 2022, Illumina believes that it has a strong case on appeal,” Illumina said in a statement.

2023-04-04 20:06:00,Market Extra: ‘We are going to see parts of the economy break’: Recession fears move back to the forefront of markets,"<p>Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesInvestors appear to be reconsidering the risk that the U.S. economy could be about to tip into a recession, following Tuesday’s data which revealed the red-hot labor market is finally loosening up. That data showed job openings fell to a 21-month low of 9.9 million in February, down from a revised 10.6 million for the prior month. Soon after those figures came out, alongside a report revealing factory orders declined a third time in the past four months, investors flocked to the safety of Treasurys — everything from 6-month T-bills BX:TMUBMUSD06M through 30-year bonds BX:TMUBMUSD30Y — and sent gold prices inching closer to record highs. Tuesday’s data dented the appeal of stocks, with Dow industrialsDJIA and the S&amp;P 500 SPX snapping four straight sessions of gains to finish lower — along with the Nasdaq Composite COMP. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY was off 0.5%. And traders now see a 98% chance that the Federal Reserve’s main interest rate target will fall by year-end from where it is now — between 4.75% and 5%; they think there’s a decent chance that policy makers will pause next month and in June before possibly cutting rates in July.The tone in financial markets has shifted since March, when stocks managed to shake off concerns about the global banking sector and posted their largest monthly gains since January. That occurred as the 2-year Treasury yield experienced its biggest one-month plunge since January 2008, and the 10-year BX:TMUBMUSD10Y declined by the most in a month since March 2020. On Tuesday, though, stocks fell in tandem with yields as traders priced in a scenario in which the Fed is essentially done with interest-rate hikes after May. Fed funds futures traders have clung to prospects of rate cuts by year-end since March, when troubles at Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse CS prompted them to factor in a full percentage point of easing from the Fed through December.“Because we’ve really seen job openings remain elevated for quite some time, today’s data was significant,” said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst for the Americas at OANDA Corp. in New York. “It looks pretty clear that we are going to see parts of the economy break and we are heading for a recession. We forget that there’s also a banking crisis going on, so there’s going to be some pain that’s really going to cripple small and medium businesses. We are going to see some tough times and are probably going to see this play out in markets.” Talk of a possible U.S. recession has gone on for about a year, without coming to fruition — helping stock investors focus on the brighter side of things and all three major indexes score year-to-date gains.Just a day ago, a surprise oil-production cut announcement led by Saudi Arabia over the weekend put the prospects of $100-per-barrel oil prices back on the radar, and initially seemed bad for the Fed’s ongoing fight against inflation. As Monday’s trading wore on, investors regarded higher oil prices as beneficial for some U.S. companies, and used the OPEC+ announcement as an opportunity to drive Dow Industrials and the S&amp;P 500 to a higher finish.While Tuesday’s job-openings data generally supports the idea that a softer labor market could help ease wage pressures, investors appeared to be more focused on the signs it is sending about the prospects for economic growth, according to Moya. “We now seem comfortable living with $100-a-barrel oil and, right now, it’s pretty clear we are recession-bound. There were a lot of people thinking an oil spike would keep inflation jitters in place, but it seems like there’s too much weakness in the economy to do that.”At bond giant PIMCO, economist Tiffany Wilding and Andrew Balls, chief investment officer of global fixed income, released a 6- to 12-month economic outlook for global markets and economies. In it, they said that recent volatility in the banking sector has raised the prospect of a significant tightening in credit conditions and, therefore, the risk of a “sooner and deeper recession.” Meanwhile, Mark Haefele, CIO of UBS Global Wealth Management, said his firm is maintaining a cautious stance on growth stocks and that a “new bull market is unlikely on the horizon.” And at BMO Capital Markets, rates strategists Ian Lyngen and Ben Jeffery said “there is mounting evidence that the notion the U.S. economy is on strong enough footing to withstand materially higher interest rates may have been misplaced.”“The JOLTS [Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey] data showed job openings decelerating a lot more rapidly than initially anticipated, suggesting the number of openings per person has fallen quite sharply,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, a senior U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities in New York.“It’s the first indication that firms are stopping their hiring sprees,” Goldberg said via phone. “The question for markets is, ‘Will this translate into weaker payroll growth in the coming months?'”TD doesn’t see a growing risk of a recession since “the labor market is quite strong,” Goldberg said. The firm expects Friday’s nonfarm payroll report to show a gain of  270,000 jobs in March,  above the 238,000 median forecast of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. “We are starting to see the first signs that the labor market is starting to react to tighter financial conditions,” Goldberg said. “But we can’t take away much from this about the next few payrolls or the depth of the next recession.” </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

MSFT could be stifling competition in the cloud-computing market, U.K. regulators on Wednesday said they were “proposing to refer” the cloud services market to the Competition and Markets Authority, the U.K. antitrust regulator, for further investigation. Britain’s media and communications regulator Ofcom said its own probe, launched in October, had so far uncovered some “concerning practices, including by some of the biggest tech firms in the world,” said Fergal Farragher, the Ofcom director leading the investigation. Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure have a combined market share of 60% to 70% in the U.K., according to Ofcom’s investigation.

Califf, in a statement.

Dimon said U.S. senators that have pointed to the banking changes as a factor in the blow-up of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank are mistaken. “Those senators are wrong,” Dimon said on CNN This Morning. “They still had higher liquidity and capital requirements and they met their exposure. It wasn’t the regulatory changes.” Dimon said JPMorgan’s role in providing $30 billion among banks to backstop a run on deposits at First Republic Bank FRC was “an attempt to give them time to resolve the situation” but did not provide additional details. Overall, Dimon said banks should be allowed to go out of business without posting a systemic risk.  “Failure is OK — you just don’t want the domino effect,” he said. Dimon said inflation will likely be here for longer than people expect, and that it’s also affecting long-term interest rates which are challenging permanent pools of capital such as sovereign wealth funds. In part one of his interview on Thursday night, Dimon said he thinks the U.S. is getting to the end of the current banking crisis, but that potential changes in regulations could have lasting effects.

A Capital One representative told the Journal it would “vigorously protect our contractual rights in court.” The Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, said Walmart had wanted to renegotiate certain agreement terms such as loss-sharing, and wanted its fintech segment to have a role in issuing cards. But Capital One balked, the Journal said. Capital One has been issuing Walmart’s credit cards since 2019, and the contract extends to at least 2026, the Journal said. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-04-10 14:56:00,: AMC stock leaps after its movie theaters had the busiest Saturday post-pandemic,"<p>Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC charged up 6.9% toward a one-month high in morning trading Monday, after the movie theater operator said 3.6 million people went to its theaters over the past three days. That makes the weekend the busiest of 2023, and the third busiest since December 2019. And since reopening in 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic forced theaters to close, two of the top three revenue days occurred over the past weekend, including Saturday, which was the highest revenue day since the reopening. And including food and beverage revenue, AMC said it set a record high for revenue during an Easter weekend at its U.S. theaters. “The success of ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie‘ is yet another shining example of the desire by U.S. moviegoers to come to the movie theatre to be entertained,” said AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron. AMC’s stock has soared 28.7% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has gained 6.3%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The inventory-to-sales ratio fell a tick to 1.37 months from 1.38. A year ago the ratio stood at a much lower 1.24. The ratio reflects how long it would take a company to sell all the goods sitting on warehouse shelves. Higher inventory levels reflect softer sales as the economy slows. Businesses have trimmed production to bring inventories more in line with demand.

In naked short selling, investors don't bother borrowing the stock first and simply sell shares with a promise to deliver them at a later date. When that promise is not fulfilled, it's known as failure to deliver. The statement was issued to update shareholders on its plan to hold a special meeting for a vote on a proposal to conduct a reverse stock split.

The proposed new rules will legalize possession of up to 25 grams, or nearly one ounce, and allow individuals to grow three plants or less. People 18 years of age or older may become members of cannabis clubs with a maximum of 500 members each. Adults under the age of 21 would be limited to 30 grams per month, which is 20 grams a month less than people aged 21 and older. The proposal will go before Germany’s lower house of parliament. The Associated Press reported that the proposal will not need to be approved by Germany’s upper house of Parliament. The Global X Cannabis ETF POTX is down 2% on Wednesday.

CUTR, a Californian provider of dermatology equipment, said Wednesday it’s terminating its executive chairman Daniel Plants and chief executive David Mowry for cause, on the recommendation of a special committee and the majority of its board. The move comes just days after Plants and Mowry issued a statement seeking the removal of five members of the board over concerns that they haven’t made progress on a CEO succession plan. The board said Wednesday it has appointed one of those members, Sheila A. Hopkins, as interim CEO, and another, Janet D. Widmann, as independent chair effective immediately. A search for a permanent CEO has begun. Plants and Mowry had called for the removal of Gregory Barrett,  Timothy O’Shea and Juliane Park along with Hopkins and Widmann. The dispute centers around the CEO succession plan which the board started to explore last November, according to Wednesday’s release. “Mr. Plants strongly recommended the immediate termination of Mr. Mowry and indicated that he wanted to succeed him as the Company’s next CEO,” said the release. “This followed a previous attempt by Mr. Plants to gain the CEO role in February 2021 by recommending removing Mr. Mowry.” The board instead decided to seek an external candidate, at which point, “in an apparent campaign to seize control of the Company, Mr. Mowry and Mr. Plants issued a press release in which they disclosed — and blatantly mischaracterized in a defamatory manner — highly confidential internal deliberations of the Board in direct violation of their employment agreements and their fiduciary duties as directors and officers under Delaware law,” said the release.

And while such short-term headwinds will soften Amazon’s growth rate, he said many of the AWS fundamentals are looking good. “Our new customer pipeline is robust, as are our active migrations,” he wrote. “Many companies use discontinuous periods like this to step back and determine what they strategically want to change, and we find an increasing number of enterprises opting out of managing their own infrastructure, and preferring to move to AWS to enjoy the agility, innovation, cost-efficiency, and security benefits.” Amazon stock has fallen 37% in the last 12 months, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has fallen 8%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

CUTR, a maker of devices used for skincare and body-sculpting, on Thursday said it would hold a special shareholder meeting on June 9 to weigh whether to remove five directors — the latest in the drama over the company’s CEO succession plans. The proposals on those removals, following concerns the directors were acting too slowly on those plans, were offered by two higher-ups that the company fired on Wednesday — executive chair Daniel Plants and chief executive David Mowry. Their dismissals came amid allegations from Cutera’s management that the two waged “an apparent campaign to seize control of the Company,” following its decision to seek an external candidate for the top spot. That campaign, Cutera alleged, involved the disclosure of “highly confidential internal deliberations of the Board in direct violation of their employment agreements.” Cutera said that as it began exploring options for a new chief executive last year, Plants called for Mowry’s “immediate termination” and indicated he wanted to succeed Mowry as CEO. Plants had made a similar move in 2021, the company alleged. Shares fell 2.2% after hours. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The company’s gene therapy plant in Harmans, Maryland near the BWI airport experienced a slower ramp of production than expected, along with operational challenges related to a new enterprise resource planning system that will impact revenue that was expected to come in the fourth quarter. “Timely resolution of these issues was delayed by the necessity of focusing site resources on important regulatory inspections involving the BWI site, which were successfully completed,” the company said in a statement.  The company expects to make up the revenue shortfall in the second half of calendar year 2023, which is the first half of its 2024 fiscal year. The company also named Ricky Hobson, current president and division head for clinical development and supply, as interim CFO. The stock is down 35% in the last 12 months, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has fallen 6%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Betterment has raised $435 million over 10 funding rounds with Bessemer Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, Globespan Capital Partners, Citi Ventures, and Kinnevik among lead investors, according to Crunchbase data.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-04-18 21:29:00,: Western Alliance says deposits are recovering; shares rally,"<p>Western Alliance Bancorp. WAL on Tuesday said that consumer deposits were recovering, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank prompted more consumers to pull money from regional financial institutions, and the company reported a year-over-year gain in net-interest income in its first quarter. “While we experienced elevated net deposit outflows immediately following the closure of other banks, deposit balances quickly stabilized with end-of-quarter deposits of $47.6 billion,” Chief Executive Kenneth Vecchione said in a statement. That figure was still down from the prior quarter and the prior-year period. But the company said deposits had increased more recently: “Since March 31, deposits have increased an additional $2.0 billion through April 14, with total insured deposits representing 73% of total deposits, which is well above industry norms compared to the 50 largest U.S. banks.” Shares rallied 13.7% after hours. Earlier this month, the bank had spooked investors, after a financial update from the company did not provide a specific figure for its deposit balance as of March 31. For its first quarter, the bank reported net income of $142.2 million, or $1.28 a share, compared with $240.1 million, or $2.22 a share, in the same quarter last year. Analysts polled by FactSet expected $1.97. Net interest income was $609.9 million, a 35.7% jump from the prior-year quarter. Management said that balance-sheet “repositioning,” which included the sale of some assets and loan reclassifications, resulted in after-tax net non-operating charges of $109.7 million. But the company said that would “have an immediate accretive impact to regulatory capital and allow us to prioritize core client relationships with holistic lending, deposit, and treasury management needs.”</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

CDW shares fell 9% after hours, following a 0.7% rise to close the regular session at $190.29. “The first quarter was marked by a period of intensifying economic uncertainty that led our customers to spend more cautiously and prioritize mission critical initiatives,” said Christine Leahy, CDW chair and chief executive, said in a statement. “This demand contraction resulted in first-quarter performance below our expectations,” Leahy said. “Volume declines were most acute with our largest commercial customers and across transactional products.” The company said it expects the U.S. IT market to contract by a high single-digit rate in 2023, and first-quarter revenue of about $5.1 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet, however, were looking for $5.58 billion. Weakness in business spending doesn’t bode well for International Business Machines Corp.

2023-04-19 17:17:00,Market Extra: U.K. inflation shock sparks fear U.S. markets will get caught off guard again,"<p>Carlos Jasso/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesPersistent double-digit inflation in the U.K. is raising fresh questions in U.S. markets about whether traders and investors are once again off the mark about the most likely trajectory for price gains. The U.K.’s year-over-year 10.1% rate for March marked the seventh straight month that inflation has been in the double digits. It’s also the highest level of any country in the Group of Seven, which also includes the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan. As Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, put it: “Once again, expectations that U.K. inflation would finally fall to single digits for the first time since last summer have been dashed.”Bond markets reacted to Wednesday’s data by sending yields up in the U.S.: The policy-sensitive 2-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y and 3-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD03Y remaining elevated in afternoon trading, but off their earlier highs. Meanwhile, U.S. stocks saw modest moves, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA off around 60 points, or almost 0.2%, and the S&amp;P 500 SPX little changed.The question at the core of the market’s thinking at the moment is whether inflation will evolve in a fundamentally similar or different manner across countries. Strategists at BMO Capital Markets have raised the risk of an outlier scenario in which recent moderation in U.S. inflation “stalls, making price stability elusive”; even so, they said the U.K.’s data didn’t give any additional weight to that case on Wednesday.At Deutsche Bank, senior economist Sanjay Raja said the firm now sees “clear upside risks” to its forecast of how high the Bank of England will end up raising rates, and now expects a 4.75% policy rate by June.Many traders are continuing to cling to a consensus view that U.S. inflation should fade as economic growth slows: In fed funds futures, they are mostly pricing in rate cuts by year-end from the Federal Reserve after one or two more rate hikes. In derivatives-like instruments known as fixings, inflation traders expect the annual headline U.S. CPI rate to fall to 4.97% for April and to as little as 2.4% by next February.Wednesday’s U.K. inflation report spurred big selling volume in Treasury futures overnight, and wasn’t entirely surprising considering this week’s “modest to low” economic data flows from the U.S., said Jim Vogel, executive vice president at FHN Financial in Memphis.“We’ve always been alert to EU [European Union] and U.K. inflation, but the story in the U.K. has been more volatile,” Vogel said via phone. “If the Bank of England thought inflation’s worst was done, and inflation surprises to the upside, why couldn’t it happen here? The idea that traders and markets could be surprised again by inflation in the U.S. got reactivated overnight.”The most recent U.S. consumer-price index report, released last week, showed the annual headline rate of inflation through March slowed to 5% from 6%, and touched the lowest level since May 2021. However, the narrower core reading which strips out food and energy, and which is seen as a more accurate predictor of inflation trends, climbed over the past 12 months. “There is always a risk that the market is underestimating the upside potential in inflation, and that’s particularly evident now in inflation surveys and TIPS prices which reflect a benign outcome,” said Mark Heppenstall, president and chief investment officer of Penn Mutual Asset Management in Horsham, Pennsylvania, which oversaw more than $31 billion in assets as of January.“Markets are generally expecting inflation to fade as economic growth slows,” he said via phone. “The consensus view is that recessions kill inflation, eventually. The key word is ‘eventually’ and it’s not clear how much damage needs to be done to the economy to get to the Fed’s 2% inflation target.”</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The company reported a $433 million fiscal third-quarter net loss, or a loss of $2.09 a share, whereas it recorded net income of $346 million, or $1.56 a share, in the year-earlier period. On an adjusted basis, Seagate lost 28 cents a share, while analysts tracked by FactSet were expecting 25 cents a share in adjusted earnings. The company’s GAAP operating expenses included a $300 million penalty for alleged violations of export regulations that were recently resolved through a settlement agreement. Revenue sank to $1.86 billion from $2.80 billion, missing the FactSet consensus, which was for $1.98 billion. “We are seeing a more elongated customer inventory correction that led to weaker than expected near-line demand among a few large customers late in the quarter,” Chief Executive Dave Mosley said in a release. “Consequently, our March-quarter revenue came in at the low-end of our guidance range, which along with underutilization charges and other factors had a severe impact on our reported margins and profitability.” For the fiscal fourth quarter, Seagate anticipates $1.7 billion in revenue at the midpoint, while analysts were expecting nearly $2.1 billion. The company’s adjusted bottom-line forecast spans a wide range, from a loss of 20 cents a share to positive earnings of 20 cents a share. Analysts tracked by FactSet were modeling 54 cents a share in adjusted earnings. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-04-21 20:08:00,Market Extra: Here’s how anxiety over the U.S. debt ceiling may play out in markets,"<p>Nathan Howard/Getty ImagesInvestors continued to pour money into the Treasury market’s shortest-dated security on Friday amid ongoing worry over the U.S. debt ceiling and the possibility that the government might default on its debts.Those worries came to the fore this week as investors sought out the safest place to hide: the 1-month Treasury bill BX:TMUBMUSD01M. Enormous demand for the bill sent its yield into a steep dive on Thursday, falling by more than half a percentage point at one point to 3.215% before paring the drop, according to Tradeweb. On Friday, the rate settled at 3.348% as of 3 p.m. Eastern time — down 18.3 basis points from Thursday’s close of 3.531%, and its lowest level since mid-October, according to Tradeweb.Volatility similar to what was seen this week is likely to keep playing out in the near term as investors avoid bills maturing in July and August, according to strategists at TD Securities. That’s the time that TD strategists say the so-called X-date is likely to be — or period after which the Treasury may not be able to pay all of the U.S. government’s bills.  “In the last week or so, 1-month bills have really started to richen, largely as investors try to avoid debt-ceiling issues and due to uncertainty about the outlook for equities and interest rates,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, a senior U.S. rates strategist at TD. “A lot of investors are hiding out in very liquid 1-month bills, but paying a high price to do so because the rate is lower than on other bills” in the Treasury market.    “It’s not just money-market funds doing it, but a number of other investors such as asset managers, who do not typically invest in the 1-month T-bill space and are keeping a significant amount of dry powder on hand,” Goldberg, based in New York, said via phone on Friday. “The closer we get to the debt-ceiling X-date, the more extreme the bills dislocation will become: bills impacted by the X-date will probably be cheaper as investors look to avoid them. Right now, equity investors are more focused on earnings and the economic backdrop, but may start to get nervous as we approach the X-date without a solution.”   Read: Fears of a Default Spur Buying Frenzy of 1-Month TreasuriesOn Friday,  Treasury yields — except for the 1-month T-bill rate — finished higher in New York trading as investors sold off most government debt and piled into the shortest-dated security. Meanwhile, all three major U.S. stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP eked out slight gains for the day, but ended modestly lower this week after the first batch of earnings reports disappointed investors.Behind this week’s anxiety in the T-bill space is the fact that federal tax receipts have come in weaker than expected, raising concern that the government could run out of money in a matter of months unless Congress raises the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling, which was reached in January, prompting Treasury to take extraordinary measures. On Friday, the cost of insuring exposure to U.S. sovereign debt reportedly rose to the highest level since 2011.On Wednesday, House Republicans unveiled a plan that would cut government spending in exchange for a higher limit on government borrowing. By contrast, the White House and congressional Democrats have called for an increase in the ceiling without conditions.Since debt-ceiling negotiations may be the most contentious since 2011, TD strategists said they see a chance that the use of the Federal Reserve’s overnight Reverse Repo (or RRP) facility could grow in the near term. The facility is largely used by money-market funds, and its usage has swelled as the result of Treasury’s decision to cut the supply of bills and the stress in the regional bank sector in March. Balances in the facility have soared to $2.3 trillion.Cash that might otherwise be going to T-bills maturing beyond one month might be pulled out of the system too quickly, resulting in a reserve-scarcity episode similar to the one seen in September 2019, Goldberg said. That “could create ripples in the financial system if we get too close to the debt ceiling without a resolution,” he said.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

It is likely to be a smaller, slower grower and, on an absolute basis, not as profitable. And, we anticipate some investors could opt to find other investments.”</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-04-25 11:41:00,: First Republic leads volume in premarket as stock falls sharply,"<p>First Republic Bank FRC is down 21% as the most heavily-traded stock in premarket action with volume of more than one million shares, according to MarketWatch’s Premarket Screener. Analysts at Raymond James said the bank’s first-quarter results released late Monday were disappointing, with a “dramatic decline in core deposit balances, increased reliance on high-cost borrowings, and substantial net interest margin compression.” First Republic aired plans to reduce its loan portfolio and cut costs, including laying off up to 25% of its workforce. “We believe FRC shares will remain volatile until we gain more clarity on the bank’s future,” said analyst David J. Long. Raymond James reiterated a market perform rating on First Republic and said it was not a surprise to see a decline in core deposits in the first quarter given its relatively high degree of uninsured deposits and high concentration of large depositors, as well as a $30 billion deposit from 11 banks in March and a downgrade of its credit to junk status in recent weeks. “While the bank has been able to secure liquidity to meet these deposit outflows in the near-term, these funding sources do not come cheap, and will cause severe profitability headwinds for the foreseeable future,” Long said. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-04-25 17:52:00,: FDA grants accelerated approval to Biogen’s treatment for rare form of ALS,"<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it has granted accelerated approval to Biogen Inc.’s BIIB torferson, a treatment for a rare form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. The accelerated approval program is used to OK drugs for serious conditions with an unmet medical need, where a drug is shown to have an effect on an endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients. In this instance, it’s for patients suffering from SOD1-ALS, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that attacks and kills the nerve cells that control voluntary muscles. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that between 16,000 and 32,000 Americans are living with ALS. Of that number, about 2% are associated with mutations in the SOD1 gene, meaning there are fewer than 500 patients with that form of ALS in the U.S. The agency based its assessment on a trial involving 147 patients ranging from 23 years old to 78. Patients receiving torferson showed “nominally significant reductions in plasma NfL concentration at Week 28 compared to the placebo arm,” the FDA said in a statement. A Phase 3 trial is ongoing. In March, an FDA advisory panel said the drug did not show it was effective. Biogen shares were down 3.3% Tuesday after the company reported earnings. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

TSLA slid 3.2% in midday trading Wednesday, to decisively break below a key Fibonacci retracement level (Fibo). After last Thursday’s post-earnings selloff took the electric vehicle maker’s stock below the 38.2% retracement level, the stock had been testing support at the 50% retracement level ($161.17) of the rally off the Jan. 3 low of $108.10 to the Feb. 14 peak of $214.24. It traded below the 50% Fibo intraday a couple times but closed above that level during the first few tests of support, until it closed at $160.67 on Tuesday. Wednesday’s selloff, after a downgrade at Jefferies, confirms the break of support. The next Fibo is the 61.8% retracement at $148.65. That level sits within another potential support zone, at the gap in the charts between the Jan. 25 intraday high of $146.41 and the Jan. 26 intraday low of $154.76. The stock has dipped into that support zone Wednesday, as the intraday low has so far been $153.21, but has pared losses to trade back above the zone.

2023-04-27 12:07:00,: Pot stocks rally as lawmakers re-introduce SAFE Banking bill to open up financial system to legal cannabis companies,"<p>The AdvisorShares Pure U.S. Cannabis ETF MSOS is rallying 16.5% and the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ is up by 6% after lawmakers late Wednesday re-introduced the SAFE Banking measure to open up the financial system to legal cannabis companies. The measure has passed the House seven times but has yet to win Senate approval. Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett said, “We think this has a real chance of passing,” in a research note published Thursday. “While we can debate U.S. cannabis fundamentals (we still think the outlook is as good, if not better, than any other industry), the thing that has been by far the biggest driver of depressed multiples has been the lack of access to institutional capital, due to being listed on the pink sheets, and the fact cannabis is federally illegal and investors potentially facing prosecution for money laundering,” Bennett said. “We think this is the year this could finally change.” Bennett noted that the latest version has 40 sponsors in the Senate including five Republicans.  The latest bill does not provide specific capital market protections, but it includes language about proceeds from state legal cannabis businesses not being considered as proceeds from an unlawful activity, Bennett said.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-04-28 19:39:00,: Analyst sees market betting on First Republic bailout as early as Friday,"<p>Odeon Capital analyst Richard Bove said the steep slide in First Republic Bank FRC stock on Friday is partly attributed to investor sentiment that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will take over the ailing bank after the closing bell on Friday. “The stock is going to down toward zero because if the FDIC takes over a bank, they do it on a Friday afternoon after the market closes,” Bove said. “The market clearly believes that’s what’s going to happen today.” The FDIC typically acts on a Friday afternoon to give itself time to open the bank up for business on Monday. At last check, First Republic stock was down 37% to $3.79 a share on Friday. Bove said it would cost the government tens of billions in losses if it takes over First Republic. A potential alternative outcome would be if First Republic sells assets to the 11 banks that provided it with $30 billion last month in more of an industry solution to backstop its balance sheet.

CVNA rallied 3.2% in premarket trading Monday, to bounce off a 7-week closing low in the previous session, after Bloomberg reported that creditors holding about 90% of the troubled used-car retailer’s bonds have proposed ways to cut debt and improve liquidity.

Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel said the debt-for-equity swap could be a “potentially BIG lifeline” for the company. “While many ‘unknowns’ exist, we are hard-pressed to envision a successful, sizable debt-for-equity swap at Carvana not proving a significant positive for CVNA shares,” Nagel wrote in a note to clients.

2023-05-02 15:32:00,: Bud Light off-premise sales fell 26.1% in week through April 22: Beer Business Daily,"<p>Anheuser-Busch InBev’s stock BUD fell 1.4% Tuesday, after a weekend report suggested further fallout on sales of Bud Light from the controversy surrounding the company’s use of a transgender influencer in its marketing. Beer Business Daily said Bud Light’s off-premise sales volume was down 26.1% in the week through April 22 from a year ago. Off-premise sales are conducted outside of bars and restaurants, and include grocery and convenience stores and liquor stores.  The shocking deterioration of Bud Light Blue’s market share “continued apace through the third week of April — and actually somehow worsened. We’ve never seen such a dramatic shift in national share in such a short period of time,” Beer Business Daily said on its website.  The partnership between the company and influencer Dylan Mulvaney hit the internet on April 1, as the Associated Press has reported. Mulvaney has 10.8 million social-media followers and many companies are turning to influencers as they seek to connect with younger generations. But the Bud Light-Mulvaney partnership quickly brought an onslaught of criticism from people who said they’re angry about the world going “woke.” Musician Kid Rock posted a video of himself shooting cans of Bud Light with a rifle. The marketing executive behind the campaign has taken a leave of absence, according to reports. Anheuser-Busch will report quarterly earnings on Thursday. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

PacWest Bancorp PACW is down 29%, Western Alliance Bancorp WAL is falling 24.6% and Metropolitan Bank Holding Corp. MCB is down by 23.8%.

JPMorgan fell 1% and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS dropped 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA dropped 1.2% and the S&amp;P 500 SPX moved lower by 1.2%. CFRA analyst Alexander Yokum said one key takeaway from the acquisition of First Republic Bank by JPMorgan is that recent regional bank failures will have a negative impact on future earnings for the banking industry. “All the costs of bank failures will be borne by banks and not taxpayers, although we expect banks to indirectly pass along many of these costs to customers through higher fees and higher interest rates on loans,” Yokum said. CFRA estimates the replenishing the government’s Deposit Insurance Fund could impact banking industry earnings by 14% over one year, and 7% impact over two years, or nearly 5% over three years.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-05-02 22:14:00,: Super Micro stock pops as earnings beat and forecast shows AI optimism,"<p>Super Micro Computer Inc. SMCI shares jumped more than 8% in after-hours trading Tuesday, following an earnings report that showed stronger-than-expected earnings and guidance. Super Micro reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $86 million, or $1.53 a share, on revenue of $1.28 billion, down from $1.36 billion a year ago. After adjusting for stock compensation and other effects, the company reported earnings of $1.63 a share, up from $1.55 a share in the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of $1.29 a share on revenue of $1.28 billion, according to FactSet. Super Micro Chief Executive Charles Liang said that demand for gear that can handle generative artificial intelligence is leading to greater demand, but that component shortages pushed some orders out of the quarter. “These new AI product demands from top-tier companies have led us to challenges in terms of new key components availability,” he said, but later said the problem had been addressed, and “we have started to produce and ship some back orders since April.” That optimism showed up in Super Micro’s forecast, which called for fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.21 to $2.71 a share on net sales of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. That guidance blew away the average analyst estimate, which called for adjusted earnings of  $1.76 a share on sales of $1.64 billion, according to FactSet. Super Micro stock has gained 146.3% in the past 12 months, as the S&amp;P 500 index SPX has increased 0.3%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
