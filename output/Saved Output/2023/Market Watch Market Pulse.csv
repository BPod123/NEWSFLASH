Tandem disclosed that it reached sales of $221 million in the fourth quarter, up from $210 million a year ago, for an annual total of $802 million. Executives reduced their annual guidance to adjusted revenue of $800 million to $805 million in November, part of a swoon in financial expectations and the company’s stock price in 2022. Shares have fallen nearly 66% in the past year, as growth has slowed down and executives have blamed the U.S. healthcare system, noting that it does not universally pay for the type of insulin pumps that Tandem sells. Executives also provided a preliminary 2023 forecast that calls for 11% to 12% sales growth from 2022’s total, which suggests an annual total approaching $900 million. Analysts on average were projecting 2023 revenue of $890.6 million, according to FactSet. Executives expect to release full fourth-quarter results on Feb. 22. Shares closed Tuesday with a 1.6% decline at $44.42 before moving to $47.50 in the extended session after the news was released.  </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

CVNA jumped 2.4% in premarket trading Tuesday, after the online used-car retailer said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, in an effort to block investors from buying up a stake while the stock price is depressed. The stock has tumbled 61.5% over the past three months through Friday, and plummeted 95.5% over the past 12 months, amid liquidity concerns due to falling used-car demand and and reports of continued layoffs. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 SPX has gained 8.7% the past three months. Carvana said Friday that the rights plan, also known on Wall Street as a “poison pill,” is designed to protect long-term shareholder value by preserving the availability of its “significant” net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs), which could be available to offset future taxable income. But the ability to use NOLs would be “substantially limited” if its 5%-shareholders increased their stake by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. So the rights plan, which the company referred to as a Tax Asset Preservation Plan, will become exercisable if an investor acquires 4.9% or more of Carvana’s outstanding common stock. Also under the plan, current shareholders that currently own at least a 4.9% stake may not buy more stock without triggering the plan.
