Tandem disclosed that it reached sales of $221 million in the fourth quarter, up from $210 million a year ago, for an annual total of $802 million. Executives reduced their annual guidance to adjusted revenue of $800 million to $805 million in November, part of a swoon in financial expectations and the company’s stock price in 2022. Shares have fallen nearly 66% in the past year, as growth has slowed down and executives have blamed the U.S. healthcare system, noting that it does not universally pay for the type of insulin pumps that Tandem sells. Executives also provided a preliminary 2023 forecast that calls for 11% to 12% sales growth from 2022’s total, which suggests an annual total approaching $900 million. Analysts on average were projecting 2023 revenue of $890.6 million, according to FactSet. Executives expect to release full fourth-quarter results on Feb. 22. Shares closed Tuesday with a 1.6% decline at $44.42 before moving to $47.50 in the extended session after the news was released.  </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

CVNA jumped 2.4% in premarket trading Tuesday, after the online used-car retailer said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, in an effort to block investors from buying up a stake while the stock price is depressed. The stock has tumbled 61.5% over the past three months through Friday, and plummeted 95.5% over the past 12 months, amid liquidity concerns due to falling used-car demand and and reports of continued layoffs. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 SPX has gained 8.7% the past three months. Carvana said Friday that the rights plan, also known on Wall Street as a “poison pill,” is designed to protect long-term shareholder value by preserving the availability of its “significant” net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs), which could be available to offset future taxable income. But the ability to use NOLs would be “substantially limited” if its 5%-shareholders increased their stake by more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. So the rights plan, which the company referred to as a Tax Asset Preservation Plan, will become exercisable if an investor acquires 4.9% or more of Carvana’s outstanding common stock. Also under the plan, current shareholders that currently own at least a 4.9% stake may not buy more stock without triggering the plan.

Betaville states that its “Uncooked” reports market “gossip” and “scuttlebutt” that hasn’t been confirmed. A company spokesperson had told MarketWatch on Friday that the company doesn’t comment on rumors or speculation. The stock has run up 82.7% so far in January but has dropped 12.3% over the past three months, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has gained 4.0% the past three months.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The S&amp;P 500 SPX gained 58.83 points, or about 1.5%, to finish January at 4,076.60, a gain of 6.2% for the month, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Investors also cheered signs that the U.S. labor market has remained strong, absorbing layoffs from a spate of firms in the finance, technology and media spaces. U.S. economic growth remained robust to finish off last year, with the advance reading on fourth-quarter GDP released last week showed growth of 2.9% year-over-year, a headline number that was larger than economists’ expectations. However, some economists have highlighted signs of trouble brewing beneath the surface, as the pace of consumption growth appears to have slowed, and other signs show a slowdown in spending on consumer goods in the face of inflation. Cyclical sectors including consumer discretionary stocks,  communications services stocks — a sector that includes many megacap technology names and media companies — information technology, materials and financials led performance on the S&amp;P 500.

HUBS said Tuesday it would layoff about 7% of its workforce, or about 500 employees, as part of a plan to cut costs.

Biden spoke after the U.S. reported that the number of new jobs created in January rose by 517,000, marking the biggest gain in six months. The unemployment rate slid to a 54-year low of 3.4% from 3.5%, the government reported. That's the lowest level since 1969.

Employment grew even faster in the waning months of 2022 than previously reported, indicating the labor market was still quite robust. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2023-02-07 12:48:00,: Spirit AeroSystems stock slides 5% premarket after company posts wider-than-expected quarterly loss,"<p>Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. stock SPR slid 5% in premarket trade Tuesday, after the aerospace company posted a wider-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter amid supply chain snafus and labor shortages. The company had a net loss of  $243 million, or $2.32 a share, for the quarter , after a loss of $120 million, or $1.15 a share, in the year-earlier period.

Revenue rose 23% to $1.320 billion, also short of the $1.424 billion FactSet consensus. Chief  Executive Tom Gentile said it was a challenging year for the entire industry.

The changes in estimates related to the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 programs, which were hit by higher labor, freight and rework costs and parts shortages.

2023-02-10 21:05:00,": Dow ends up 170 points Friday, but Nasdaq snaps 5-week win streak","<p>U.S. stocks closed mostly higher on Friday, but the three major indexes still posted their a round of weekly losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA added about 169 points, or 0.8%, ending near 33,869, while booking a 0.2% weekly decline, according to preliminary FactSet data. The S&amp;P 500 index SPX advanced 0.2% Friday and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP closed 0.6% lower. They fell 1.1% and 2.4% for the week, respectively. That snapped the rate-sensitive Nasdaq’s string of 5 straight weeks of gains, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Investor optimism around the Federal Reserve nearing the end of its rate hiking cycle helped push stocks higher to kick off the year, but bullishness has since eased with corporate earnings sagging and Fed officials warning that rates could stay high for some time. Despite the bite of higher interest rates, U.S. consumer sentiment data for February released on Friday signaled a cautious optimism about the economy. Another signal, the U.S. Treasury market yield curve, however, continued to warn about the potential for a U.S. recession, with the 2-year Treasury rate BX:TMUBMUSD02Y at about 4.5% on Friday and the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y at 3.7%, a deep inversion of the two rates that has often appeared before downturns in the past.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
