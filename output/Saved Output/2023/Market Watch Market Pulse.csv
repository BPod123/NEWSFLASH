The average for deaths was 317, down 23% from two weeks ago. The NYT trackers said there is reason to believe case and death counts could artificially low, as those who track those numbers take vacation for the Christmas and New Year holidays, but hospitalization data isn't typically affected by holiday reporting breaks. COVID-related patients in intensive care units (ICUs) rose 11% in two weeks to 5,350. Meanwhile, the test positivity rate climbed to 15%, and has increased by 23% over the past two weeks. Higher test positivity rates suggest many new COVID cases are not being reported, as many found through at-home tests may not be reported to case trackers.
