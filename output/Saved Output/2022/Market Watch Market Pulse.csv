There's the ""potential liquidation of 56.3M HOOD shares (7.4% of outstanding) owned by Sam Bankman-Fried through Emergent Fidelity Technologies,"" though the timing of that is ""uncertain"" in Allen's view. Additionally, FTX's implosion has removed it from the list of possible Robinhood acquirers.

It should further have known its own internal risk management procedures were inadequate to prevent it and that staff were not following anti-money laundering processes and complying with laws. That allowed them to transact billions of dollars in suspicious transactions in the U.S. and other countries in the period stretching from 2009 to 2016 that accounted for 99% of the branch's profit. None of the customers were residents of Estonia. The complaint also alleges that Danske knew of the transactions, but made ""materially misleading statements and omissions in its public reporting. Corporations that raise money from the public must disclose information that is material to investors, who then get to decide what risks they want to take. That's the basic bargain of our securities laws and it extends to foreign issuers like Danske Bank, which sought to access our capital markets, even though its securities were not registered with the Commission,"" said Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement. Danske's U.S.-listed shares were slightly lower on Tuesday. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-12-13 21:01:08,"Dow ends up 105 points Tuesday, stocks post back-to-back gains as inflation data cools","<p>U.S. stocks closed higher Tuesday in a choppy session, after a gauge of consumer prices showed inflation continued to retreat from its June peak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose about 105 points, or 0.3%, ending near 34,110, according to FactSet, after initially climbing about 700 points in early trade. The S&amp;P 500 index  gained 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite Index  advanced 1%. The latest consumer-price index for November showed annual inflation slowed to 7.1% from 7.7% a month before, adding to the retreat in the cost of living from a pandemic peak of 9.1% in June. Lower inflation, though still painfully high, gave more hope to investors that the Federal Reserve might be able to increase rates at a less dramatic pace than earlier in 2022, while potentially pausing at a ""terminal,"" or peak, rate that produces a soft-ish landing for the U.S. economy. Bond yields fell Tuesday after the inflation reading, with the 10-year Treasury rate tumbling 11.1 basis points to 3.5%, the biggest daily yield decline for the benchmark rate since Dec. 1, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The focus remains on Wednesday's Fed rate decision, with expectations running high for a 50 basis point increase, a step down from the  recent series of four 75 basis point hikes.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
