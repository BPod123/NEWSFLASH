Separately, the company said long-time Chief Executive Joe Flanagan will step down from the role after almost 10 years with the company.

Excluding nonrecurring items, such as a $9.5 million increase in allowance for credit losses, FactSet said adjusted earnings per share of 8 cents missed the consensus estimate of 14 cents. The company disclosed that the increased allowance for credit losses was for a physician customer facing ""financial challenges"" that was unable to make a ""contractually required payment"" on Sept. 30.

Revenue for the latest quarter grew 30.6% to $496.0 million, but was below the FactSet consensus of $523.7 million.

The company said recent regulatory developments relating to its ovarian cancer drug Rubraca and challenges in raising fresh capital, ""a potential bankruptcy filing in the very near term looks increasingly probable as a way to preserve the value of our business and assets for the benefit of our stakeholders."" For now, the company is still evaluating its strategic options and discussing in and out of bankruptcy financing options with creditors, Clovis said in a regulatory filing. Rubraca is the company's sole product, but it faces steep competition from AstraZeneca   and Merck's  Lynparza and GSK's   Zejula, which are approved in the first-line maintenance ovarian cancer setting and have become the standard of care. Rubraca is approved as a second-line maintenance treatment for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who respond to chemo. That is a smaller and shrinking patient pool, given the competition from Lynparza and Zejula. The Food and Drug Administration has told Clovis it requires more mature patient survival data from its late-stage trial dubbed Athena-Mono and said it would closely scrutinize its application for approval. Clovis had a net loss of $56 million in the third quarter, narrower than the $67.4 million loss posted in the year-earlier period.

""In what has been a dark comedy show with Twitter, Musk has essentially tarnished the Tesla story/stock and is starting to potentially impact the Tesla brand with this ongoing Twitter train wreck disaster,"" Ives wrote in a note to clients. ""From selling Tesla stock again and again, to the PR nightmare that Twitter has become, cutting 50% of employees and then needing to bring some back, Musk's attention focus from Tesla to Twitter, and ultimately the fear that this Twitter lightening rod of controversy on a daily (almost hourly) basis starts to negatively change the Tesla brand globally."" Tesla IS Musk, Ives wrote, and it has made him the richest man in the world. Tesla is the golden child of his empire, and he's changed the auto world much in the way that Apple's  iPhone changed phones. But now he has managed to do what short sellers tried and failed -- to crush Tesla's stock despite the EV company being in a position of strength. Ives said he still believes in the EV story as a longer-term play, but Tesla's roughly 25% selloff since the Twitter deal is ""an agonizing cycle for investors to navigate and has put massive pressure on the stock as its a Boy Who Cried Wolf narrative shaping up."" Ives is sticking with his outperform rating on Tesla stock but lowered his price target to $250 from $300 to reflect the overhang.

2022-11-16 21:29:00,"Market Extra: More trouble is brewing in the $24 trillion Treasury market: This time, it’s about central clearing","<p>Stefani Reynolds/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesEfforts to reduce risks within the nearly $24 trillion U.S. Treasury market, the world’s deepest and most liquid securities market, are ironically creating angst among market players. The anxiety is centered on the concept of central clearing,  a method used to reduce and manage risks in financial markets. In September, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rules that would mandate the central clearing of a large swath of Treasury transactions. Only a small percentage of such transactions have centrally cleared in recent years.The biggest concern about central clearing is the cost of participating in it, according to a panel discussion at the 2022 U.S. Treasury Market Conference held at the New York Fed on Wednesday. Though panel participants generally agreed that the efforts would help to improve the Treasury market’s resiliency, they said that some players might not be able to absorb the additional costs and that it’s not clear how well the central-clearing system would work during periods of turmoil. “The cost of transacting in the Treasury market is going to go up and, as dealers, we are concerned about that,” said Kavi Gupta, co-head of global rates trading and counterparty portfolio management for BofA Securities. Though larger players may adapt, smaller ones may not and the topic is “something our clients actively talk about.” Concerns about  liquidity in the Treasury market have been brewing for months, particularly as the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening process kicked into high gear. In October, BofA Securities warned that the “fragile” market was at risk of “large scale forced selling” or a surprise that might lead to a breakdown. And earlier this month, the Fed confirmed fears about low liquidity in what has historically been one of the financial system’s most stable corners.Liquidity refers to the ease with which securities can be bought and sold, and a lack of it means that Treasurys can’t be transacted smoothly without significantly impacting the underlying prices on government debt. Exacerbating liquidity woes is the departure of big, regular buyers and the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes to combat inflation, which have generally encouraged investors to sell off bonds this year. If the cost of transacting Treasurys becomes prohibitive for smaller dealers, then the question becomes “are you indirectly reducing liquidity” for the market, said panel participant Lynn Paschen, a senior portfolio manager at Schwab Asset Management. “That would be my main concern.” In addition, some funds are required to invest in Treasurys and additional costs may need to be passed on to shareholders, she said.Gerald Pucci, Jr.,  managing director and global head of repo at BlackRock BLK, said he worries about rising costs for the firm’s pension- fund clients. “I would think any kind of central clearing, on the margin, is a positive,” but if undertaken too quickly “could be problematic.”Most Treasury yields slipped on Wednesday, despite strong October retail-sales data. The 10-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD10Y fell below 3.7%, sending a popular bond-market gauge of impending recessions to the most negative level in more than 40 years. Earlier on Wednesday, New York Fed President John Williams told conference participants that the Treasury market’s liquidity problems have the potential to interfere with the central bank’s ability to transmit monetary policy to the economy. Meanwhile, Nellie Liang, undersecretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department, said that the UST market needs to be monitored for vulnerabilities, given the risks of a potential shock.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

He also said that price stability is a “must-have” for the central bank and that the Treasury market “is at the center of it all,” so the “time is now” to find ways to strengthen core parts of financial system. “If the Treasury market isn’t functioning well, it can impede the transmission of monetary policy to the economy,” he said. The almost $24 trillion Treasury market is the world’s deepest and most liquid securities market, and provides the benchmark levels at which interest rates are set across the U.S. economy. By hiking interest rates aggressively to arrest inflation, policy makers are trying to tighten financial conditions and slow the economy down. See also: More trouble is brewing in the $24 trillion Treasury market: This time, it’s about central clearingLiquidity concerns have plagued the market for months, and the Fed confirmed those fears earlier this month in its financial stability report. The remarks by Williams came as one of the  bond market’s most popular recession gauges shrank to its most negative level in more than 40 years on Wednesday, in a worrisome sign about the outlook. The inversion was driven primarily by a steep drop in the 10-year yield, BX:TMUBMUSD10Y which fell 10.5 basis points to 3.693%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The divergence in stock moves appears to be primarily because while both are broadline retailers, they are actually part of very different sectors. As Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Astrachan noted, more than half of Walmart's sales are from the grocery category, which is why the company is labeled a consumer staple, which is considered defensive during economic slowdowns as it sells what consumer's need over what they want. But with only about one-fifth of Target's sales in the grocery category, Target is considered a consumer discretionary, which is more susceptible to economic slowdowns.

Qatar is the first country in the Arab World to host the World Cup, although the tournament has been mired in controversy.

Within minutes Ecuador forward Valencia had the ball in the back of the net following a mistake by Qatar goalkeeper Saad Al Sheeb, but the goal was ruled out by the Video Assistant Referee. It was a nervy start from Qatar on their World Cup debut and Ecuador continued to press, with Valencia winning a penalty after a quarter of an hour when he was fouled by Al Sheeb. The striker duly sent the Qatar keeper the wrong way for the tournament’s opening goal. Valencia doubled Ecuador’s lead on 31 minutes with an emphatic header into the bottom corner from Angelo Preciado’s cross.

As the soccer showpiece began, Ecuador thought they had opened the scoring through Enner Valencia just minutes after kickoff, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside after a check by the Video Assistant Referee. Ecuador took the lead after 16 minutes when Valencia converted a penalty to score the first goal of the World Cup.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose about 200 points, or 0.6%, ending near 33,747 Friday. The S&amp;P 500 index  closed up 0.5%, but failed to end above the 4,000 mark after trading above that level several times intraday in past sessions this week. The Nasdaq Composite Index  eked out a 0.01% gain Friday. Stocks wobbled earlier this week after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the central bank's rate could end up as high as 7%, up from the current 3.75% to 4% range. Higher rates make it more expensive for households and businesses to borrow. This tightening cycle differs from the recent past in that the central bank has been raising rates into what appears to be a slowing economy, with economists and investors seeing the risks of recession increasing as the Fed tightens the screws of financing conditions. The Dow ended the week flat, while the S&amp;P 500 posted a 0.7% weekly decline and the Nasdaq shed 1.6%, according to FactSet. Stocks have ended lower in two of the past three weeks.

In May, BNY Mellon Investment Advisor paid a $1.5 million penalty to the SEC after the agency claimed there were misstatements and omissions concerning its ESG considerations.

That's a positive for UGG, which generates about half its annual revenue in the fourth quarter, Nikic wrote in a note to clients. Highlights include that UGG was one of the only brands tracked by Wedbush that was less promotional last week in the direct-to-consumer channel versus last year and one of few that saw growth in online searches, ""which suggests that interest in the brand remains high even as most other brands see less robust demand,"" said the note. Other positives include longer-than-usual lines at stores and significant buzz on social media. Overall footwear and apparel saw high levels of discounting. ""While most retailers and brands have telegraphed that this Holiday season will be promotional, so this doesn't come as a total surprise, the question that needs to be answered from here becomes: ""Were the Black Friday promos successful enough to keep pricing somewhat rational through yearend? Or are we headed for a race to the bottom between now and January,"" wrote Nikic. Deckers stock was not yet active premarket, but have gained 4% in the year to date, outperforming the S&amp;P 500  which has fallen 15%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-11-28 21:02:00,"Market Extra: ‘We see major stock markets plunging 25% from levels somewhat above today’s,’ Deutsche Bank says","<p>Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesA U.S. recession induced by central-bank efforts to curb inflation is likely to arrive by mid-2023 and trigger a sharp and “temporarily painful” decline in equities, according to Deutsche Bank researchers.“We see major stock markets plunging 25% from levels somewhat above today’s when the U.S. recession hits, but then recovering fully by year-end 2023, assuming the recession lasts only several quarters,” said David Folkerts-Landau, group chief economist and global head of research, and Peter Hooper, global head of economic research.In a note released on Monday, the researchers cited persistently high wage and price inflation in the U.S. and Europe driven by robust demand, tight labor markets, and supply shocks for their thinking. Based on the historical record of several major industrial countries since the 1960s, any time trending inflation has declined by 2 percentage points or more, such a decline has been accompanied or induced by a rise in unemployment of at least 2 percentage points. Currently, they estimated, inflation trends in the U.S. and Europe are running around 4 points above desired levels. Deutsche Bank DB isn’t alone in its thinking. In July, legendary investor Jeremy Grantham warned that stocks could plunge 25% as the “superbubble” continues to pop. In August, Citi research analyst Christopher Danley wrote that chip stocks could drop by that magnitude as investors enter “the worst semiconductor downturn in a decade.” And earlier this month, a team of analysts at Morgan Stanley MS analysts led by Mike Wilson implied that the S&amp;P 500 SPX could see further downside of up to 25% if a recession hits.Read:S&amp;P 500 to bottom in the first quarter, creating a ‘terrific buying opportunity,’ says Morgan Stanley’s Wilson A downturn may already be under way in Germany, where Deutsche Bank is based, and in the eurozone as a result of the energy shock triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Deutsche Bank researchers said. Meanwhile, the Fed and European Central Bank are “absolutely committed” to bringing inflation down in the next several years, and “it will not be possible to do so without at least moderate economic downturns in the U.S. and Europe, and significant increases in unemployment.”“The good news is that we also think the Fed and ECB will succeed in theirmissions as they stick to their guns in the face of what is likely to be withering public opposition as unemployment mounts,” Folkerts-Landau and Hooper wrote. “Doing so now will also set the stage for a more sustainable economic and financial recovery into 2024.”U.S. stocks got a lift last week after the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s most recent meeting indicated that policy makers expect a slower pace of rate increases will likely be appropriate soon. On Monday, though, waves of protests in China triggered ripples of unease across financial markets, with all three major stock indexes, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, finishing sharply lower. In April, Deutsche Bank became the first major Wall Street bank to forecast a U.S. recession at some point. And in June, it saw a risk that inflation would either accelerate or fail to decelerate fast enough. The annual headline inflation rate derived from the U.S. consumer-price index fell to 7.7% in October after coming in above 8% for seven straight months.On Monday, Deutsche Bank’s researchers said they expect U.S. output to decline 2% in the year ahead. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Banks are talking about returning money to a victim's bank once a bank determines that a customer was tricked into sending money to the wrong account. The scam victim would get a refund from their bank. The move comes as Sen. Elizabeth Warren calls for more reimbursements for fraud from banks and as scammers increase their sophistication with caller IDs that match the name of the individual's bank. A spokesperson for Early Warning Services LLC, the parent of Zelle, told The WSJ that fraud and scam claims have been made on fewer than 0.1% of payments.

2022-11-29 20:35:00,Market Extra: Most deeply inverted Treasury curve in more than 4 decades has one upbeat takeaway for investors,"<p>Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesOne of the bond market’s most reliable indicators of impending U.S. recessions is pointed in a pretty pessimistic direction right now, but contains at least one optimistic message: The Federal Reserve will remain committed to its battle on inflation and, some analysts say, should ultimately win it.The spread between 2- BX:TMUBMUSD02Y  and 10-year Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y is stuck at one of its most negative levels since 1981-1982  after shrinking to as little as minus 78.5 basis points on Tuesday. Over the past week, it’s even approached minus 80 basis points. The more deeply negative the spread becomes, the more worrisome of a signal it’s emitting about the severity of  the next economic downturn. Read:Bond-market recession gauge hits 41-year milestone as global growth fears mountBut there’s more than one way to read this measure: The spread also reflects the degree to which the bond market still has confidence that policy makers will do what’s needed to bring down inflation running near its highest levels of the past four decades. The policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield finished the New York session at 4.47% on Tuesday, and is up by 370.7 basis points since January,  as traders factor in further Fed interest rate hikes. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield was at 3.75% — roughly 72 basis points below the 2-year yield, resulting in a deeply negative spread — and at a level that indicates traders aren’t factoring in a whole lot of additional premium based on the possibility of higher, long-term inflation. Higher and stickier yields at the front end of the curve are “a sign of Fed credibility,” with the central bank seen committed to keeping monetary policy restrictive for longer to rein in inflation, said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy for Société Générale. “Unfortunately, tighter policy will lead to demand destruction and lower growth, which is keeping long-end yields depressed.”In theory, lower economic growth equates to lower inflation, which helps the Fed do its job of controlling prices. The million-dollar question in financial markets, though, is just how quickly inflation will come down to more normal levels closer to 2%. History shows that Fed rate hikes have no apparent maximum impact on inflation for about 1.5 to 2 years, according to famed economist Milton Friedman, who was cited in an August blog by Atlanta Fed researchers.“The yield curve will likely remain inverted until there is a clear sign of a policy pivot from the Fed,” Rajappa wrote in an email to MarketWatch on Tuesday. Asked whether the deeply inverted curve indicates central bankers will ultimately be successful in curbing inflation, she said, “It is not a question of if, but when. While inflation should steadily decline over the upcoming year, strong employment and sticky services inflation might delay the outcome.”Ordinarily, the Treasury yield curve slopes upward, not downward, when the bond market sees brighter growth prospects ahead. In addition, investors demand more compensation to hold a note or bond for a longer period of time, which also leads to an upward sloping Treasury curve. That’s part of the reason why inversions grab so much attention. And at the moment, multiple parts of the bond market, not just the 2s/10s spread, are inverted. For Ben Jeffery, a rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets, a deeply inverted curve “shows that the Fed has moved aggressively and will keep rates on hold in restrictive territory despite a quickly dimming economic outlook.”The 2s/10s spread hasn’t been this far below zero since the early years of Ronald Reagan’s presidency. In October 1981, when the 2s10s spread shrank to as little as minus 96.8 basis points, the annual headline inflation rate from the consumer-price index was above 10%, the fed-funds rate was around 19% under then-Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, and the U.S. economy was in the midst of one of its worst downturns since the Great Depression. Volcker’s bold moves paid off, though, with the annual headline CPI rate dropping below 10% the following month and continuing to fall more steeply in the months and years that followed. Inflation hadn’t reared its head again until last year and again this year, when the annual headline CPI rate went above 8% for seven straight months before dipping to 7.7% in October. On Tuesday, Treasury yields were little changed to higher as traders assessed more hawkish rhetoric from Fed policy makers such as St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who said on Monday that the central bank will likely need to keep its benchmark interest rate above 5% for most of next year and into 2024 to cool inflation.Right now, “a deeply inverted yield curve signals the Fed is somewhat overtightening, but the impact on inflation may take some time to come through,” said Ben Emons, a senior portfolio manager and the head of fixed income/macro strategy at NewEdge Wealth in New York.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-11-30 21:03:00,Market Extra: Treasury-bill market’s march toward 5% gets interrupted by Fed’s Powell,"<p>MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphotoFor much of Wednesday, the yield on the one-year Treasury bill was marching closer to 5% and appeared on track to finish the New York session at its highest level in 15 years. Then, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stepped in. In an afternoon speech, Powell said the pace of interest-rate increases by Fed officials may slow as soon as their Dec. 13-14 meeting. Those comments took some of the momentum off the 1-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD01Y, which had climbed to almost 4.9% earlier in the day but settled below 4.8% after Powell’s remarks to the Brookings Institution.Read:Powell says pace of interest-rate increases can slow as soon as December meetingTraders’ decision to push the one-year rate closer to 5% hasn’t been a swift or easy one to make, even for fast-moving financial markets that are usually adept at figuring out the central bank’s next steps. On Wednesday, Powell kept alive the idea of the Fed pushing borrowing costs above 5% in 2023, by saying that the likely ultimate level for interest rates will be “somewhat higher” than 4.75% and that history warns against “prematurely loosening policy.” The prospect of a 5% fed-funds rate target has been around since at least September, when Deutsche BankXE:DBK, Wall Street’s most pessimistic bank, flicked at the idea of something close to that level. But until Wednesday, many market players had held back on pricing in such a scenario because of October’s smaller-than-expected rise in inflation, which raised hopes of a less-aggressive policy stance by the Fed.After Powell’s remarks on Wednesday, fed-funds futures traders boosted the likelihood of a half-percentage-point hike by the Fed on Dec. 14 to 77% versus 66% a day ago.They also held on to decent chances of additional rate hikes next year that would push the Fed’s main policy rate target above 5%, up from a current range between 3.75% and 4%. The Fed’s December meeting includes the release of rate projections, which will give financial markets more clues about how much higher interest rates could go. “There was hope from the market that there could be a Fed pivot, but when you look through the [Fed’s November meeting] minutes and what some have said, officials are still going to tighten financial conditions” since inflation hasn’t moved down enough,  said Robert Daly, director of fixed income for Glenmede Investment Management in Philadelphia. “There’s a lot of cash on the sidelines so buying yield in fixed income is what investors are doing. Buyers are coming back in the belly and long end as a protection mechanism for their portfolios,” resulting in relatively lower yields on 5-, 7-, 10-, and 30-year maturities, which were all trading below 4% on Wednesday.An almost 5% level on the one-year T-bill yield BX:TMUBMUSD01Y could eventually spill over into other rates, such as the two-year T-bill rate  BX:TMUBMUSD02Y, and raise jitters in the broader financial market in much the same way that the market’s move toward a 4% level for rates did. In addition, some analysts said, it’s likely to result in an even more deeply inverted Treasury curve that emits even more worrisome signals about the economic outlook.“You could see the 2-year rate going above 5%” with each leg higher showing up as “nervousness in the markets,” as well as a deeper inversion of the Treasury curve that points to more fear of the U.S. falling into a recession, Daly said via phone.  The last time that the one-year T-bill yield climbed to levels comparable to Wednesday’s was on Aug. 8, 2007, when it hit 4.89%, according to FactSet data. In January 2007, the 1-year closed as high as 5.12%. On Wednesday, most Treasury yields finished the New York session lower, with the exceptions of the 3-month, 1-year and 30-year rates.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell about 194 points, or 0.6%, ending near 34,395. The S&amp;P 500 index  fell 0.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  rose 0.1%, according to FactSet. Stocks rallied sharply on Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated the central bank may soon downsize its pace or rate hikes after a series of jumbo increases of 75 basis points to the Fed's policy rate. That has brought the benchmark rate to a range of 3.75% to 4%, its highest level in 15 years. But signs that U.S. inflation may be falling after being stuck near a 40-year high have encouraged Fed officials and investors, with the 10-year Treasury rate falling to 3.6% Thursday, its lowest yield in about two months, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The next big economic item for investors will be the release on Friday of October jobs data, which could help determine the size of the Fed's next rate hike during its Dec. 13-14 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The odds currently favor a 50 basis point increase.    </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-12-03 16:36:00,Market Extra: Most deeply inverted Treasury curve in more than 4 decades has one upbeat takeaway for investors,"<p>Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesOne of the bond market’s most reliable indicators of impending U.S. recessions is pointed in a pretty pessimistic direction right now, but contains at least one optimistic message: The Federal Reserve will remain committed to its battle on inflation and, some analysts say, should ultimately win it.The spread between 2- BX:TMUBMUSD02Y  and 10-year Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y is stuck at one of its most negative levels since 1981-1982  at minus 67.3 basis points on Wednesday, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The more deeply negative the spread becomes, the more worrisome of a signal it’s emitting about the severity of  the next economic downturn. Read:Bond-market recession gauge hits 41-year milestone as global growth fears mountBut there’s more than one way to read this measure: The spread also reflects the degree to which the bond market still has confidence that policy makers will do what’s needed to bring down inflation running near its highest levels of the past four decades. The policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield ended the New York trading session on Wednesday at 4.37%, up by 360.8 basis points since January, with traders pricing in further rate hikes as well as a slowing pace of them as soon as December. Meanwhile, the 10-year yield was at 3.7% — or 67.3 basis points below the 2-year yield, resulting in a deeply negative spread — and at a level that indicates traders aren’t factoring in a whole lot of additional premium based on the possibility of higher, long-term inflation. Higher and stickier yields at the front end of the curve are “a sign of Fed credibility,” with the central bank seen committed to keeping monetary policy restrictive for longer to rein in inflation, said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy for Société Générale. “Unfortunately, tighter policy will lead to demand destruction and lower growth, which is keeping long-end yields depressed.”In theory, lower economic growth equates to lower inflation, which helps the Fed do its job of controlling prices. The million-dollar question in financial markets, though, is just how quickly inflation will come down to more normal levels closer to 2%. History shows that Fed rate hikes have no apparent maximum impact on inflation for about 1.5 to 2 years, according to famed economist Milton Friedman, who was cited in an August blog by Atlanta Fed researchers.“The yield curve will likely remain inverted until there is a clear sign of a policy pivot from the Fed,” Rajappa wrote in an email to MarketWatch on Tuesday. Asked whether the deeply inverted curve indicates central bankers will ultimately be successful in curbing inflation, she said, “It is not a question of if, but when. While inflation should steadily decline over the upcoming year, strong employment and sticky services inflation might delay the outcome.”Ordinarily, the Treasury yield curve slopes upward, not downward, when the bond market sees brighter growth prospects ahead. In addition, investors demand more compensation to hold a note or bond for a longer period of time, which also leads to an upward sloping Treasury curve. That’s part of the reason why inversions grab so much attention. And at the moment, multiple parts of the bond market, not just the 2s/10s spread, are inverted. For Ben Jeffery, a rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets, a deeply inverted curve “shows that the Fed has moved aggressively and will keep rates on hold in restrictive territory despite a quickly dimming economic outlook.”The 2s/10s spread hasn’t been so far below zero as it recently has since the early years of Ronald Reagan’s presidency. In October 1981, when the 2s10s spread shrank to as little as minus 96.8 basis points, the annual headline inflation rate from the consumer-price index was above 10%, the fed-funds rate was around 19% under then-Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, and the U.S. economy was in the midst of one of its worst downturns since the Great Depression. Volcker’s bold moves paid off, though, with the annual headline CPI rate dropping below 10% the following month and continuing to fall more steeply in the months and years that followed. Inflation hadn’t reared its head again until last year and again this year, when the annual headline CPI rate went above 8% for seven straight months before dipping to 7.7% in October. On Wednesday, most Treasury yields slipped after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Chairman said the pace of interest-rate hikes could slow as soon as policy makers’ next meeting in two weeks. The 10- and 30-year rates finished November’s final trading session with their biggest monthly drops in two to three years.Right now, “a deeply inverted yield curve signals the Fed is somewhat overtightening, but the impact on inflation may take some time to come through,” said Ben Emons, a senior portfolio manager and the head of fixed income/macro strategy at NewEdge Wealth in New York.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-12-05 16:56:00,"Currencies: Global financial system vulnerable to $80 trillion-plus problem in FX market, warns BIS","<p>Fabrice Coffrini/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesThere’s a “huge, missing and growing” problem inside the round-the-clock foreign-exchange market, and it’s one that can’t be seen. That’s according to the Bank for International Settlements, which cited trillions in dollar debt by non-U.S. borrowers contained in FX swaps/forwards and currency swaps which do not appear on balance sheets and are missing from statistics. Non-U.S. banks owe upwards of $35 trillion, while non-bank entities outside the U.S. owe as much as $25 trillion, the BIS said in a quarterly report. The total amount in outstanding obligations embedded inside the foreign-exchange market, however, is closer to “$80 trillion-plus,” the report said.“The $80 trillion-plus in outstanding obligations to pay US dollars in FX swaps/forwards and currency swaps, mostly very short-term, exceeds the stocks of dollar Treasury bills, repo and commercial paper combined,” according to the report written by Claudio Borio, Patrick McGuire, and Robert McCauley.FX swap markets, in particular, are vulnerable to funding squeezes and the lack of information about the dollar debt “makes it harder for policy makers to anticipate the scale and geography or dollar rollover needs,” they said. “Thus, in times of crisis, policies to restore the smooth flow of short-term dollars in the financial system (eg central bank swap lines) are set in a fog.”A global squeeze on dollars is one big way that the strong greenback can reverberate around the world. For much of 2022, the dollar has been on a tear and wreaking havoc, though it fell off dramatically in November — shrinking its gain over the past 12 months to 8.9% from 20.6% in late October, based on the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY.The Bank for International Settlements, based in Basel, Switzerland, is regarded as the central bank for central banks, with a unique but often overlooked role in the international financial system. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
