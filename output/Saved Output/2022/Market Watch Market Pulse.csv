2022-09-12 12:37:28,Cable One stock downgraded as Wells Fargo sees various pressures on cable industry,"<p>Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall downgraded shares of Cable One Inc.  to equal-weight from overweight Monday, warning of the spending trajectory ahead for the broader cable universe. ""While we think CABO has the strongest/best network-nearly 70% fiber by mileage-it's also well known that incremental competition is coming to all areas, including rural,"" Cahall wrote. He expects that the upcoming capital-expenditure cycle in the cable industry will pressure free-cash flow for Cable One and fellow providers. He predicts Cable One will have to spend $200 for each home passed, compared with $300 for both Comcast Corp.  and Charter Communications Inc. , and perhaps $600 for Altice USA Inc. . ""While our capex may be too heavy in the near term, we think we're directionally right for the sector that a build phase is ahead,"" Cahell wrote. ""While CABO's capex cycle may be somewhat less severe vs peers, it's still a necessity, as competition in rural markets is increasing from FWA, fiber, and eventually, satellite."" Additionally, though Cahall sees Cable One as ""still the best house"" in the challenged cable neighborhood, he doubts the company will be ""immune"" to pressures in the industry. ""We think CABO's markets skew to lower-income cohorts, hence inflation and higher gas prices have a bigger impact on sub metrics,"" he wrote, while cutting his price target on the stock to $1,200 from $1,700.

2022-09-12 20:40:00,"The Tell: Traders see inflation falling for rest of 2022, but that likely won’t end Fed rate hikes or market volatility","<p>Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesThere’s a bit of good and bad news in the run-up to the next major U.S. inflation data on Tuesday,  following July’s bigger-than-expected decline in the U.S. consumer-price index which triggered a short-term relief rally among stock investors.The corner of financial markets with money on the line in getting the CPI data just right is expecting a continued drop in inflation for August and the rest of the year. Traders of derivatives-like instruments known as fixings now expect August’s annual headline inflation rate to be 8.1%, down from 8.5% in July. They also see the rate gradually declining to 7.7% for September, 6.9% for October, almost 6.4% for November, and 6.1% for December. The problem is that the decline still likely won’t be nearly enough to put an end to continued rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, or the market volatility that accompanies them.Read:Inflation is slowing, U.S. August CPI to show, but not enough to mollify a worried FedThe reason is that the number that matters almost as much as the annual headline CPI rate is the so-called core reading, which kicks out volatile food and energy prices, said Gang Hu, an inflation trader with New York hedge fund WinShore Capital Partners. By his calculations, headline inflation readings at these levels through year-end imply monthly core readings of 0.3%, or 3.6% on a 12-month basis. “There’s been quite a bit of change after the last CPI report, and the market definitely sees readings that are a fair amount lower than where they were before,” Hu said via phone on Monday. “You could have a relief rally in bonds and equities if these numbers are realized, but I don’t think the relief rally is going to stay.”“The Fed is going to hike 75 basis points next week, to above 3%. But core inflation is stabilizing around the wrong levels, and if you have inflation at 0.3% for the next three to four months, the job is not done and the Fed will have to keep going,” Hu said via phone. “We don’t know how much further the Fed will have to keep going or when is going to be enough.”  Hu isn’t alone in his views. Robert Conzo, chief executive and managing director of The Wealth Alliance in Melville, New York, which oversees $1.5 billion, said that while he thinks CPI is on a downward trend, the degree to which that happens and just how sticky inflation may remain is still unknown. Once those trends become more apparent, that will give the Fed a firm direction, he said in an email. And once the central bank’s rate-hike cycle ends is when investors will see the next big recovery in stocks, according to Conzo.As of Monday, stock investors appeared to be somewhat optimistic. All three major stock indexes DJIASPX COMP finished with their fourth straight session of gains, adding to last week’s gains. Treasury yields were mixed, though the policy-sensitive 2-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD02Y was still at its highest level since November 2007. Fed funds futures traders were pricing in a 67% chance that the Fed’s main policy rate target will get to between 3.75% and 4% by December, up from a current level of between 2.25% and 2.5%. And fixings traders are expecting an annual headline CPI inflation rate that eventually subsides to around 2.7% next July, but the truth is “the market doesn’t have much idea of what’s going to happen five months from now,” Hu said.“The Fed’s concern is less about spot inflation. The big concern is about inflation expectations,” said the WinShore Capital Partners trader. “The Fed has to firmly control inflation expectations so spot inflation doesn’t completely change the view of inflation in society. Retail gas is coming down very quickly, but, on the other side, food and rent prices continue to go up. So the Fed has no choice but to show markets it’s in control of inflation.”</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-09-16 20:02:00,The Tell: Wall Street’s most pessimistic bank sees almost 5% fed-funds rate on horizon,"<p>Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesAs financial market gloom continued to deepen on Friday, Deutsche Bank, Wall Street’s most pessimistic bank, came out with yet another eye-opening view: Its U.S. economists, led by Matt Luzzetti, now expect the Federal Reserve to end its rate-hike campaign at 4.9% in 2023’s first quarter.The notion of an almost 5% fed-funds rate, which in Deutsche Bank’s own words is “way beyond” what the market is pricing, comes just days ahead of the Fed’s next meeting on Sept. 20-21 and as investors remain anxious about how high interest rates will have to go to tame the worst stretch of inflation in four decades. Investors were still trying to wrap their heads around the likelihood that the fed-funds rate target will likely rise above 4% by year-end, and the stock market sold off on Friday — fueled by a profit warning by FedEx Corp. FDX, along with inflation and rate fears.Few market participants have openly talked about the prospect of an almost 5% fed-funds rate target, essentially double the current level of 2.25% to 2.5%. Such a scenario could have an even more punishing effect on stocks than what’s been predicted by billionaire investor and hedge-fund manager Ray Dalio, who estimates that a 4.5% level on rates would produce a 20% negative impact on equity prices. Meanwhile, one key market rate — the one-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD01Y — hovered near 4% on Friday, a development that some say could spill over into other rates and exacerbate worries throughout financial markets, in the U.S. and abroad. Deutsche Bank’s revised interest-rate forecast “is all about the inflation profile and how we expect inflation to remain at higher levels for longer,” Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist, said via phone. “The Fed has always gotten the fed-funds rate target above inflation during all of its past tightening cycles, whether inflation was high or not.”“For policy to be restrictive, real or inflation-adjusted rates need to be positive and, right now, Fed officials can’t rely on forecasts about inflation to decline over time,” he told MarketWatch. “For them to have confidence, they need to get the fed-funds rate above inflation, at least by early next year,” he said, although Deutsche Bank doesn’t expect an almost 5% fed-funds rate to be sustained for very long.  Deutsche Bank’s U.S. economists revised their expectations after Tuesday’s unexpectedly hot consumer-price index report for August, and the upgrade is now closer to the 5% to 6% range that some at the bank think is needed to cool inflation.Friday brought another downbeat day in financial markets, with all three major stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP finishing lower after trimming earlier heavy losses. FedEx’s profit warning was being read by some, such as BNP Paribas Chief U.S. Economist Carl Riccadonna, as fitting into his view that a “massive deceleration” is under way for the U.S. economy.Deutsche Bank was the first major Wall Street bank to call a U.S. recession in April. That same month, it went out further on a limb to say that it saw downside risk to its own pessimistic view. In June, Tim Wessel, a macro strategist, said he saw a chance that inflation fails to decelerate. And just three days ago, Henry Allen, a research analyst, said “that the pessimists will sadly prevail on this occasion” when it comes to the debate over whether the U.S. economy can achieve a soft landing.  On Friday, Deutsche Bank was joined by Dutch financial-services company Rabobank, with another take on the prospect of higher-than-expected rates. Strategist Philip Marey said Rabobank now expects the fed-funds rate to peak at 5% next year, up from its prior forecast of 4.5%, given persistent inflation and a wage-price spiral that’s already under way. Rabobank also doesn’t expect the Fed to pivot from its rate stance before 2024.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

FedEx's stock plunged 19.6% toward a two-year low, after saying late Thursday that it suffered lower global volumes, a trend that worsened toward the end of the quarter and is expected to weaken further in the current quarter. Citi's Wetherbee said it's hard to assume UPS isn't affected by the macro/service headwinds that FedEx noted, but his conversations with UPS management suggest ""a level of confidence"" that they did better in matching costs and revenue. He wrote in a research note that FedEx's warning was clearly a negative for UPS, ""but we think UPS continues to execute more effectively and with some [market] share gains, it should be a relative outperformer."" UPS stock, which had already dropped 7.6% amid a three-day losing streak through Thursday, has dropped 13.7% year to date, while FedEx shares have tumbled 20.8%, the Dow Jones Transportation Average  has dropped 18.0% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has shed 14.8%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-09-20 20:24:00,"The Tell: Fed-funds rate could end up as high as 5%, says overseer of $1.3 trillion in assets","<p>Win McNamee/Getty ImagesIn the run-up to Wednesday’s policy announcement by the Federal Reserve, SEI, an overseer of $1.3 trillion in assets, sees a likelihood that the central bank’s hiking cycle will end at a level that leaves interest rates twice as high as they are now. The Oaks, Pennsylvania-based firm sees a “reasonable base case” that the level at which Fed officials will stop hiking rates is between 4.5% to 5%, according to chief market strategist Jim Solloway. That’s double the current level between 2.25% and 2.5% and above the 4.25% to 4.5% range that traders are mostly expecting for year-end, though it’s not far from where market expectations are increasingly heading for next year, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.For now, the broader financial market has remained focused on the likelihood that Wednesday’s rate hike will be 75 basis points, plus the slim chance it might be a jumbo-size full-percentage-point hike — which would push borrowing costs into a range that’s at or above 3%. Generally speaking, investors have yet to fully wrap their heads around the risk of a 5% level by next year. Policy makers’ updated projections, released on Wednesday, will signal how much higher they’re willing to keep pushing rates next year and over the long run.Read:Why stock-market investors fear a full percentage point Fed rate hike would ‘unnerve’ Wall Street Some — like Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist for Capital Economics — still see the possibility that the Fed could shift back to smaller increments of hikes after Wednesday’s widely expected move, under the assumption that inflation should ease soon. However, inflation has proven to be stubbornly persistent, and if the Fed pencils in further rate hikes for 2023, that could easily push the fed-funds rate target above 4.5%.“Given our view for continued resilience in U.S. economic growth and higher-for-longer inflation, the Fed will need to keep raising rates into 2023,” SEI’s Solloway wrote in an email on Tuesday. “A peak funds rate of 4.5%-to-5% is a reasonable base case, but the risks appear skewed to the upside.”SEI isn’t alone in its views. U.S. economists at Deutsche Bank, Wall Street’s most pessimistic bank, expect the Federal Reserve to end its rate-hike campaign at 4.9% in 2023’s first quarter. Meanwhile, strategist Philip Marey of Dutch financial-services company Rabobank expects the fed-funds rate to peak at 5% next year, and doesn’t expect the Fed to pivot from its rate stance before 2024.U.S. stocks finished sharply lower ahead of Wednesday’s policy update from the Fed, with Dow industrials DJIA ending down by more than 300 points. Meanwhile, most Treasury yields continued to climb, with the 10-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD10Y hitting a fresh 11-year high of 3.57%.See:The stock market has rallied on day of every Fed rate-hike decision in 2022.

2022-09-21 16:19:00,In One Chart: Fed’s tough task: History shows inflation takes average of 10 years to return to 2%,"<p>Mario Tama/Getty ImagesAfter more than a year in which most professional forecasters and financial-market players regularly misjudged the persistency of inflation, they may now be missing out on one key fact.History shows that inflation takes an average of 10 years to return to 2% once it breaks above 5%, according to Thanos Vamvakidis, a strategist for BofA Securities in the U.K. That’s based on decades worth of data across advanced countries. And it’s a much longer period than the consensus view, in which inflation in G-10 countries is expected to drop to 2% by 2024, Vamvakidis wrote in a note Wednesday.Source: IMF, BofA Global ResearchThe ramifications of BofA’s view, coming just hours before the Federal Reserve is widely expected to deliver another aggressive rate hike and unveil the possible path of hikes going forward, is that investors may once again be underestimating the fortitude required for policy makers to bring the hottest inflation era of the past four decades to a heel. A few firms, such as SEI, which oversees $1.3 trillion in assets, see the likelihood that the central bank’s hiking cycle will end at a level that’s as high as 5%, twice as high as where interest rates sat before the Fed’s policy announcement Wednesday.The annual headline inflation rate in the consumer-price index has been above 8% for months, and the narrower gauge which strips out food and energy costs showed no signs of a let up in August. Meanwhile, the rate of inflation over the past year based on the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, known as the personal-consumption expenditures price index, dropped to 6.3% for July; its narrower core measure came in at 4.6% for the 12-month period.“The consensus today is too optimistic,” Vamvakidis wrote. “In a positive scenario, inflation starts to move in the right direction at a sufficient pace for central banks (CBs) to avoid a hard landing, even if inflation remains above 2% in the medium term. In a negative scenario, inflation is persistent and sticky on the way down, forcing central banks to a hard landing.”“Our baseline is the positive scenario, but risks for the negative scenario are increasing,” the strategist said. Inflation has yet to peak, “labor markets are stretched, real policy rates are still deeply negative, fiscal policies are loose, and structural reforms are not even part of the policy discussions.”In the minutes of their last meeting in July, policy makers acknowledged that inflation would likely stay uncomfortably high, and some indicated interest rates would probably need to stay in sufficiently restrictive territory “for some time.” Restrictive territory is defined as the level that would restrict economic growth, in order to combat high inflation.Ahead of the Fed’s policy update Wednesday afternoon, financial markets were in wait-and-see mode, with all three major stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP higher in morning trading. Treasury yields stabilized, though the 10-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD10Y slipped from an 11-year high.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-09-26 15:15:00,"The Tell: First thing Fed breaks with higher rates will be the financial markets, BMO says","<p>Source: iStockphotoThe Federal Reserve is the proverbial bull in the china shop, prepared to create damage with higher interest rates to bring down the hottest inflation spell of the past 40 years.The first thing that will break is the financial markets, “as currently unfolding,” BMO Capital Markets economists Michael Gregory and Sal Guatieri said in a note Monday. Dow industrials were on the brink of falling into a bear market, while the S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq Composite are already in one; a dollar at more than 20-year highs is causing havoc around the world; and lending conditions are tightening as more Treasury yields rise above or touch 4% — the level some see as sending shivers through investors.Financial markets continued to search for positive momentum on Monday, after U.S. stocks closed sharply lower in Friday’s session and ended with weekly losses. The three major indexes DJIASPXCOMP were mixed in morning trading, while the 7- and 20-year Treasury yields briefly reached 4% on Monday as 2- and 3-year rates climbed further above 4.2%.“Based on our in-house measure, financial conditions are set to carve 2 percentage points from U.S. GDP growth next year,” Gregory and Guatieri wrote. “This reflects the punishing effects of the mighty greenback, the angry bear market in equities, wider credit spreads and tighter lending conditions, and assumes another 150 bps (basis points) of Fed rate hikes and a 15% slide in house prices. At the very least, the financial clouds have the words ‘shallow recession’ written all over them.” They see the U.S. posting back-to-back declines in quarterly real GDP in the first half of next year, and the unemployment rate rising to 5% from August’s 3.7% level by late next year.Reached by phone on Monday, Guatieri, based in Toronto, said “we’ve already seen financial conditions come under undue pressure, with the S&amp;P 500 down more than 20%, bond markets very weak, and corporate credit spreads widening significantly. It all points to a much weaker economy in the year ahead.” The BMO economists now see the Fed ending its rate hike campaign between 4.5% to 4.75%, three-quarters of a percentage point higher than they had previously expected. The additional 75 basis points in hikes will turn out to be the “straw that breaks the camel’s back,” to use another proverb. And the world’s largest economy “is past the point of rescue” as the Fed pledges to restore price stability at all costs, they said.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The Arms (or TRIN) tends to rise above 1.000 when the stock market falls, as the ratio of declining volume to advancing volume exceeds the ratio of the number of declining stocks to the number advancing stocks. With the Dow Jones Industrial Average  dropping 576 points, or 1.9%, and the S&amp;P 500  sinking 2.5% in morning trading, the NYSE Arms rose to 2.558, as decliners outnumbered advancers by 16.1 to 1, while declining volume topped up volume by 41.3 to 1. Many on Wall Street interpret a reading of 2.000 as a sign of panic selling, which some view as a contrarian bullish signal, since it suggests capitulation. But the last time the NYSE Arms closed above 2.000 was when the Dow dropped 107.1 points on Sept. 22, and the Dow fell 486 points the next day. Before that, the Arms closed above 2.7988 on Sept. 13 when the Dow slid 1,276 points, but the Dow rose just 30 points the next day before starting a six-day losing streak in which it tumbled 1,885 points.

2022-09-30 20:55:00,Market Extra: ‘Painfully slow capitulation’: Why investors keep getting inflation wrong,"<p>Getty Images/iStockphotoA brutal third quarter in financial markets came to a close on Friday and one thing is overwhelmingly clear: Inflation is the single most important factor driving asset valuations right now and yet few, if any, people are able to accurately predict where it’s likely to go.The reason? Professional forecasters, policy makers and traders all keep dismissing the way inflation behaved in the 1970s, according to BofA Securities global economist Ethan Harris. That’s when inflation — fueled by the war in Vietnam of the previous decade — proved to be unrelenting, forcing three different Fed chairmen to push interest rates above 10% until the fever of rampant price gains finally broke in the 1980s.Read:Investors may be in for a rude surprise: History shows inflation can take years to return to normal even when the Fed hikes interest rates above 10%Friday’s data releases only underscored the resiliency of inflation: U.S. stocks finished lower on the day, while posting their third straight quarter of declines, after a hotter-than-expected reading within the personal-consumption expenditures price index for August. The eurozone also reported a record 10% annual inflation rate this month. Meanwhile, economists, policy makers and traders are all factoring in a path for U.S. inflation that falls toward or below 3% in 2023.The ramifications of underestimating inflation’s persistency are huge for financial markets, creating the potential to add further losses on top of the trillions of dollars of destruction in U.S. wealth that’s already occurred in 2022. It was the worst September for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 of the past decade, and financial markets are on track for their worst year in at least a half-century. The ordinarily safe world of global bonds fell into its first bear market in 76 years this month, as traders and investors braced for a period of continued rate hikes by central banks. And the dollar — the undisputed winner of 2022’s extreme volatility — is at 20-year highs, leading to speculation about whether an intervention might be needed.Read:‘True carnage’: Stock-market selloff wipes $13 trillion in market cap off broad U.S. benchmark and 2022 has been the worst year for markets (so far) in at least 50 yearsEconomists, policy makers and investors are operating with “a number of potential biases,” according to Harris at BofA Securities. “The biggest bias has been to ignore the lessons of the 1970s, assume the Phillips curve is essentially dead and dismiss evidence to the contrary,” he said. The Phillips curve is the economic theory that concludes lower unemployment is associated with higher inflation. The U.S. jobless rate has been below 4% for much of this year, putting pressure on wages, even as hopes remain that inflation will ultimately ease. “The result has been a painfully slow capitulation process that culminated in the past month.”Indeed, financial markets ended September’s final trading session on a downbeat note. For the third quarter, Dow industrials DJIA  fell  2,049.92 points, or 6.7%, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX  lost 5.3% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped 4.1%. Meanwhile on Friday, Treasury yields posted their largest multi-quarter gains since the 1980s amid a relentless selloff of government debt. And the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY remained around its highest level since 2002.Inflationary forces unleashed by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have reverberated around the world, and it’s been nearly impossible to quantify the continued impact. In 2022, it is pandemic-era dynamics that are fundamentally driving inflation — including outsize stimulus that created a surge in demand and a “less-engaged workforce” that’s reconsidering when, how and where it’s willing to take jobs, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. The primary difference between the 1970s and 2022 is that food and energy prices were the primary driver of underlying inflation a half-century ago, Colas wrote in a note Friday. Severe global supply disruptions and higher demand are what triggered food inflation starting in 1972 and 1973, he said. Meanwhile, energy inflation came in two waves: The first being the 1973 Saudi oil embargo and the second being the supply disruptions caused by the 1978-1979 Iranian revolution.Right now, labor-market conditions “will be harder for Fed policy to address,” Colas said.The headline annual rate of the consumer-price index has been above 8% for six straight months from March to August, and traders of derivatives-like instruments known as fixings foresee at least one more 8%-plus reading for September. Optimism that inflation would soon ease was buttressed by an unexpected downside surprise in July’s reading, but that faded after August’s worrisome rise in the core rate of inflation that omits food and energy prices.Fed officials remain hopeful, though. On Friday, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said all signs point to lower U.S. inflation in coming months.But inflation has flummoxed even the financial market’s most sophisticated traders, who appear at somewhat of a loss when it comes to where inflation might go after the next three months. They see the annual CPI rate coming in at 8.1% in August, 7.3% in October and 6.5% or lower for November and December — before falling to around 2% by June.The reality, though, is that any estimates beyond the next three months should be read as a message that “we don’t know where inflation is heading,” said Gang Hu, a trader of Treasury inflation-protected securities at New York hedge fund WinShore Capital Partners.Hu says he, too, has been overly optimistic that inflation would show signs of meaningfully easing by now. “We are all used to thinking and modeling linearly, and there’s no model capable of describing what’s happening right now.” </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  tumbled about 495 points Friday, or 1.7%, ending near 28,730 as heavy selling intensified into the closing bell. The S&amp;P 500 index [s:spx] shed 1.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  finished down 1.5%. Losses for the week and month were far worse. The Dow led the major stock indexes lower with a 2.9% weekly skid, to end September down 8.8%. But the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq recorded bigger monthly losses of 9.3% and 10.5%, respectively, according to FactSet data. The Federal Reserve's unwavering stance in September on raising rates until inflation finds a path down to its 2% target has been blamed for the sharp selloff. The task has been complicated by a roaring labor market and soaring home prices, which keep pressure on shelter costs. Home prices have only begun to show signs of a retreat after gaining 45% nationally during the pandemic, which will keep focus on next week's jobs update for August. For the year so far, the Dow fell 21%, the S&amp;P 500 skid 24.8% and the Nasdaq shed 32.4%, which marked their worst first 9-month fall in a year since 2002, according to Dow Jones Market Data.      </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
