Black Knight said the slowdown to 17.3% annual home price growth in June from 19.3% was broad based was a record by far, ""and it wasn't even close,"" said Black Knight Data & Analytics President Ben Graboske; in comparison, the strongest single-month slowing during the 2006 housing downturn was 1.19 percentage points. The slowdown comes along with a 22% increase in the number of homes listed for sale the past two months, which was the biggest inventory gain in 12 years. The company said the ""clear driver"" of the inventory gains is a decline in sales activity, resulting from the lowest levels of home affordability in nearly 40 years due to rising interest rates. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-08-02 11:02:00,Arconic tops Q2 estimates but stock falls on soft guidance,"<p>Arconic Corp.  said Tuesday it had net income of $114 million, or $1.05 a share, in the second quarter, after a loss of $427 million, or $3.89 a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales climbed 41% to $2.5 billion. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of 73 cents and sales of $2.4 billion. The maker of aluminum for cars and airplanes said sales were boosted by the ramp up of packaging sales in the U.S., growth in ground transportation and building and construction sales, a recovery in aerospace, and aluminum prices. The company is tweaking its full-year guidance to reflect falling aluminum prices and their impact on revenue and working capital. It now expects revenue to range from $9.6 billion to $10.0 billion, compared with previous guidance of $10.1 billion to $10.5 billion. The forecast is based on expectations for LME aluminum prices of $2,500/mt and Midwest Premium of $700/mt, reduced from prior assumptions for LME of $3,350/mt and Midwest Premium of $850/mt when the company announced first-quarter earnings. Arconic also said it is pausing plans to sell its Kawneer business, a deal it had mooted in early June, because of the current uncertainty in the debt markets. ""Kawneer is a very valuable business and the Company does not believe it would receive proper value for it under current economic and market conditions,"" Arconic said in a statement.

2022-08-02 20:04:00,Market Extra: Why China-Taiwan tensions moved to the forefront of financial market worries,"<p>Sam Yeh/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesIt’s an island off the coast of China, with a land area comparable to Maryland and Delaware combined. Its population is about 1 million higher than that of Florida.Often overlooked in world headlines, Taiwan grabbed the financial market’s attention as the biggest macro risk of the day, prompting many traders and investors to turn briefly away from concerns about recession, inflation, central banks and Russia’s war on Ukraine. The focus was on U.S. Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, which triggered fears of retaliation by the island’s giant neighbor China. Earlier on Tuesday, global stocks sold off on the geopolitical tension, while investors scrambled to the safety of U.S. Treasurys and traders took a second look at their positions across assets. After Pelosi’s plane landed safely in Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, market sentiment seemed to improve in the stock market, with the S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq Composite temporarily popping higher.“Macro investors have been counting on China’s reopening to stabilize positions,” said Jim Vogel, a Memphis-based executive vice president and interest-rate strategist at FHN Financial. They’ve pared allocations to equities and have been counting on floors for commodity prices, as well as limits to downside price action in fixed income. Now, however, relying on China “as an international growth driver is unreliable,” Vogel wrote in a note Tuesday. What’s more, China’s intentions toward Taiwan “have been obvious and threatening for years,” and the narrative between the two “will not go away for years.”  Pelosi is the highest-ranking American politician to visit the island of Taiwan in 25 years, when then-Speaker Newt Gingrich arrived in 1997. On Tuesday, jitters first emerged in Asian markets, which were “shaky” in the morning amid fears that China’s military jets “could buzz Pelosi’s plane,” said Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist for AGF Investments. Valliere described the potential for a mistake by either side as “quite serious.”Chinese President Xi Jinping is seen by intelligence experts as needing a “diversion” from his country’s struggling economy and attempts to recover from “exceptionally harsh” COVID restrictions, according to Valliere. At the same time, China’s president “cannot afford to look weak” as he seeks a third term in office later this year. Meanwhile, Beijing sees Taiwan as a threat, given the island’s healthy economy and personal freedoms. Taiwan is generally regarded as the most democratic place in East Asia. Pelosi’s visit will have a “major” impact — resulting in further deterioration of relations between the U.S. and China, “with little hope for a reconciliation on trade,” the AGF strategist said.Frantic traders had been tracking every move of Pelosi’s plane on popular flight trackers, and it was flight-to-safety sentiment that drove bond yields lower earlier on Tuesday, according to Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors in New York. He described the bond market’s moves as being the result of “the Nancy Pelosi kerfuffle.”According to senior analyst Neil Thomas and others at Eurasia Group, a New York-based consulting firm, “Pelosi’s visit will significantly raise U.S.-China tensions but is unlikely to produce a Chinese reaction that risks conflict.”Eurasia Group sees “a 25% chance of a major security crisis, such as a prolonged U.S.-China military standoff that threatens further escalation,” they wrote in a note. Still, Beijing could order additional military air and naval exercises,  might sanction the U.S. delegation and freeze bilateral exchanges, and has the potential to consider boycotts and sanctions on Taiwan and U.S. firms, the consultancy said.On Tuesday, all three major U.S. stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP finished lower. Meanwhile, investors sold off government bonds, sending yields higher across the board in a reversal of Tuesday’s earlier bond rally.     </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-08-02 18:36:00,"The Tell: Financial markets may see three-month string of 8.8%  inflation readings starting next week, adding up to `bad news’","<p>Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesThe financial market’s most knowledgeable inflation traders are expecting a string of roughly 8.8% annual headline U.S. consumer-price readings over the next three months, starting with the Aug. 10 release of July’s data.While such readings would be below June’s 9.1% reading and support the theory that inflation may have peaked at an almost 41-year high, the expectations of inflation-derivatives traders still adds up to what could be a lot of bad news for the broader market. The reason boils down to the length of time that high U.S. inflation persists, which would upend the hopes of investors, traders and policy makers for a relatively quicker and meaningful slowdown in price gains.Read:‘Peak inflation’ trade is driving financial markets as investors brace for U.S. economic slowdownThe string of 8.8% figures — broken down as 8.78% for July, 8.75% for August and 8.79% for September — already takes into account the recent decline in gas prices  — along with a drop in commodities, such as wheat W00 — and would come while the Federal Reserve is in the midst of an aggressive rate-hike campaign. Hopes that inflation may have peaked in June may be obscuring the risk that a wage-price spiral could still develop and that price gains in other areas, like shelter, could accelerate or remain sticky, some say.“It’s bad news to have inflation last so high for so long,” said Derek Tang, an economist at Monetary Policy Analytics in Washington.  “The longer high inflation lasts, the more worried Fed officials get that inflation expectations are getting unanchored, and they can’t allow that.” While much still depends on labor-market data and whether a wage-price spiral unfolds, “people are going to price in a higher fed funds rate for the end of year and rate hikes lasting longer into 2023, with the first rate cut not happening until later,” Tang said via phone on Tuesday. Three annual headline CPI prints of essentially 9% “make it hard to see how the Fed is going to start cutting rates in 2023. Inflation that starts to come down is good, but the question is, ‘Does it come down soon enough?’ ” The Fed has a window to prove it’s going to bring inflation down, and people are going to start losing faith in that story.”For the time being, financial markets appear to be broadly accepting the idea that the central bank will more or less get a handle on inflation in the long run: Five-, 10- and 30-year breakeven rates remain contained within a range of 2.2% to 2.7%, while yields on Treasury inflation-protected securities are off their multi-year highs but moving up on Tuesday, according to Tradeweb data. In addition, all three major U.S. stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP are off the lows they reached in June, when inflation fears dominated. After a jump in growth and technology-related stocks in July, there’s now a question over how recessionary risks will weigh on their recent bear-market rally. Ed Perks of Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions said in a phone interview late last week that the market may be looking through “rose-colored glasses.” “We still have pretty tough sledding ahead of us,” he added. On Tuesday, major stock indexes were lower in afternoon trading as investors also factored in geopolitical risks between the U.S. and China. Meanwhile, Treasury yields were broadly higher as investors sold off government debt, reversing course from earlier in the day. “If we are going to get a labor/price shock, equities might be affected very heavily,” Tang of Monetary Policy Analytics told MarketWatch. Soaring labor costs heading into economic weakness “is going to hit revenues and could be an issue for profit margins.” “The bigger issue is that the market may be misunderstanding how serious the Fed is about inflation,” he said. “It may be wishful thinking to think the Fed can bring it back down to 2%.” On Tuesday,  two top officials at the Fed said the central bank needs to raise interest rates a lot higher and probably keep them high for awhile to contain the worst outbreak of inflation in almost 41 years.Read:Top Fed officials say U.S. interest rates to keep rising until high inflation eases</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-08-09 20:11:00,Market Extra: Don’t be fooled by a drop in U.S. headline inflation. Markets will be attuned to another figure on Wednesday.,"<p>Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesTraders, investors and economists are all counting on Wednesday’s consumer-price index report to show a decline in the annual headline U.S. inflation rate for July. But there’s another figure buried in the consumer-price index data that has the propensity to jolt markets.It’s called the core year-over-year CPI reading, a measure which strips out volatile food and energy costs. It came in at 5.9% for the 12 months that ended in June, and the consensus view is that it will inch up to 6.1% on a year-over-year basis for July. Gargi Chaudhuri of BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest money manager, sees the core reading coming in even a bit higher, at 6.2%, while a pair of Goldman Sachs analysts are warning that the near-term U.S. inflation picture “is likely to remain uncomfortably high.”Read:Goldman Sachs says it’s too soon for markets to be trading `a full Fed pivot’ A move higher in the annual CPI core rate would be significant because it would be seen as reflecting the true underlying trend of inflation — while also dashing widespread hopes in financial markets over the past month that price gains have peaked. Many traders and investors have generally been clinging to the overall annual headline CPI rate for July, which includes food and energy — and the view that it probably fell to 8.7% or 8.8%, from an almost 41-year high of 9.1% in June, after factoring in recent declines in gas and commodity prices.See: U.S. consumers likely got some relief from sizzling price increases in July but Fed won’t feel any better“The outlook for inflation remains the primary concern for investors,” Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors’ Chief Investment Officer Tony Roth and Chief Economist Luke Tilley wrote in an email on Tuesday. “Persistent inflation is weighing on sentiment for consumers and businesses, yet economic data remains quite mixed and concerns are elevated that aggressive Fed policy could push the U.S. into recession.”“While we still expect inflation to decelerate going forward, some components will remain stubbornly high and complicate the outlook,” they said.Signs of the financial market’s broad-based expectations that inflation is poised to ease are abundant: U.S. stocks have generally rallied from their lows in mid-June, though they finished lower on Tuesday. Meanwhile, medium- and long-term Treasury yields have dropped from their peaks in June — along with break-even rates, according to Tradeweb data. In the round-the-clock currency market, where the dollar remains sensitive to U.S. data surprises, “the market needs to decide whether slowing headline is more important than sticky and strong core,” said TD Securities strategists Oscar Munoz, Mazen Issa, and Gennadiy Goldberg.At Pennsylvania-based Hirtle Callaghan & Co., which oversees about $20 billion in assets, Brad Conger, deputy chief investment officer, said he thinks inflation and the Federal Reserve’s willingness to tackle it are both being underestimated. Conger sees inflation growth pivoting away from goods to services, while noting how hard it is to “wrench” pricing knowledge away once inflation takes hold. “Suppose you work at a firm of 1,000 people,” Conger wrote in an email. “In the month of May, 28 of your colleagues quit and accepted new offers…Your employer grants everyone else the economy-wide average hourly wage increase of 3.6% at an annualized rate. But here’s the rub. The 972 employees who stayed know precisely what the leavers accepted at their new position. It has become their new reserve price of labor. This is how inertia develops in inflation and why it’s so hard to eradicate.”“Rent works the same way,” said the deputy chief investment officer. “A small proportion of new tenant leases show up in the average, but everyone else knows what the new effective rent is.”On Tuesday, all three major stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP closed lower, led by a 1.2% slide in the Nasdaq Composite, with investors reluctant to put on big trades ahead of Wednesday’s CPI data. Meanwhile, the Treasury curve turned more deeply inverted as the spread between 2- and 10-year yields shrank to an intraday low of almost minus 50 basis points, with the 2-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD02Y rising at a faster pace than the 10-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD10Y. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell about 56 points, or 0.2%, ending near 32,776. The S&amp;P 500 index  shed 0.4%, booking its fourth session in a row of declines, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  shed 1.2%, according to FactSet data. Investors have been trying to gauge whether or not the red-hot U.S. labor market and other key aspects of inflation have become entrenched in the American economy, potentially making the central bank's goal of price stability harder to achieve, despite its recent course of jumbo rate hikes. That's made Wednesday's release of the July consumer-price index a key focus for investors. The CPI update is expected to show moderating price increases from last month, helping to pull the annual rate down to 8.7% from 9.1% in June, in part as households feel a bit of relief at the gas pump.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-08-09 15:23:00,The Tell: Goldman Sachs says it’s too soon for markets to be trading ‘a full Fed pivot’,"<p>Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesJust ahead of Wednesday’s widely anticipated U.S. consumer price index report for July,  a pair of Goldman Sachs analysts are warning that the U.S.’s near-term inflation picture “is likely to remain uncomfortably high” and that financial markets are “more vulnerable” to upside surprises than before.The reason is that, for the past month or so, markets have been preoccupied with a scenario in which Federal Reserve policy makers can ultimately revert back to easier policy — or give up on aggressive rate hikes — on the presumption that inflation has peaked. That sentiment is reflected in nominal and real yields that have fallen nearly 100 basis and 85 basis points, respectively, from June to the start of August, analysts Dominic Wilson and Vickie Chang wrote in a note Monday. And it’s also demonstrated in Goldman Sachs’s own U.S. Financial Conditions Index, which has eased by 70 basis points from its peak, they said.Meanwhile, however, measures of inflation’s “breadth” have generally been rising and Goldman Sachs GS expects price gains to stay elevated in the next few months and likely through the end of the year. Indeed, some of the financial market’s brightest minds on inflation have been expecting a string of roughly 8.8% annual headline CPI readings, starting on Wednesday, for the next three months — even after factoring in recent declines in gas and commodity prices. “Our central view has been that it is too early for the market to be trading a fullFed pivot,” Wilson and Chang wrote. In addition, “the market has worried too much about imminent recession,” and “the more the growth outlook improves, the more the Fed will need to make sure financial conditions stay tight.”“The near-term inflation picture is likely to remain uncomfortably high,” they said. While there should be relative relief in headline inflation and in core goods prices in the next few months, “core services prices are likely to rise further on a year-over-year basis and stay firmer on a sequential basis too, in part because of ongoing firmness in shelter inflation.”Wilson and Chang aren’t alone in their view. Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said that while Wednesday’s annual headline CPI rate may reflect a “welcome reprieve” from a 9.1% rate in June,  the data “may prove underwhelming” and one month’s minimal decline “should not have a material impact on the [Federal Open Market] Committee’s latest hawkish rhetoric, or plans to move forward with a potential third-round 75bp hike in September.” The Fed has raised the target on its main policy rate to a range of between 2.25% and 2.5% since March, up from between 0% and 0.25% earlier this year. Now, traders of fed funds futures see a 65.5% chance of a 75-basis-point hike in September and 34.5%  likelihood of a 50-basis-point move. They see a 70.9% chance the fed-funds-rate target gets to at least between 3.5% and 3.75%  by next March, before the Fed cuts rates later in 2023, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.  On Tuesday, as traders settled into wait-and-see mode ahead of the July CPI report, all three major stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP were lower in morning trading. Meanwhile, Treasury yields popped higher across the board on government-bond selling, sending the 2-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD02Yup to 3.26% and the 10-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD10Y up to almost 2.8%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-08-10 16:28:00,Market Extra: Stock-market investors cheer July inflation data. Big-name firms like PIMCO aren’t so sure.,"<p>Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesWednesday’s release of the consumer-price index reportfor July contained enough downside surprises to give stock investors hope the worst of inflation may be behind. Yet an undercurrent of worry remained at big-name firms like PIMCO, where the focus was on stickier components of the data that may only get worse.According to PIMCO economists Tiffany Wilding and Allison Boxer, the details of the report were “firmer” than what was implied by the annual headline CPI rate — which fell to 8.5% for July from 9.1% in June and came in below the expectations of economists and inflation-derivatives traders. If food and energy prices continue to ease, June will likely prove to be the peak in year-over-year headline inflation, Wilding and Boxer wrote in a note. But the annual core measure, which strips out food and energy, “will likely reaccelerate in August, and isn’t likely to peak until September.” The so-called core reading, which excludes volatile items, matters to many in financial markets because it’s supposed to represent a true underlying read on inflation — though there’s some debate over which time frame of the core gauge is most relevant. The core gauge came in unchanged at 5.9% for the 12 months that ended in July, and at 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, down from 0.7% in June. Wilding and Boxer point out that the categories which drove July’s weakness in core — airfares and hotels — “tend to be more volatile, whereas the stickier components (rents/Owners-Equivalent-Rent) remained firm.” In addition, the economists said, other core measures of inflation from the Cleveland Fed, New York Fed and Atlanta Fed “have all accelerated” — with the depth and breadth of inflationary pressures across items spreading out. Meanwhile, wage inflation has also broadened from low-wage, low-skills services positions into a range of industries, jobs, and skill levels, they said.“Today’s print didn’t change our forecast for core inflation of 5.5% and 3.5% year-over-year, for 2022 and 2023, respectively, nor did it change our near-term outlook for the Fed,” the PIMCO economists said. They still see a relatively high chance of another 75 basis points in September.  Bond giant PIMCO, which managed $1.82 trillion as of June, isn’t alone in sharing its hesitancy about July’s CPI data, even while economists at BofA Securities and Jefferies called a peak in inflation. Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, said “we’ll need a few more of these to call a peak and to see a meaningful downward trend.” Meanwhile, Comerica Bank’s Bill Adams said the U.S. is at risk of “another energy price shock” over the winter in the likely event that Europe suffers an energy shortage.Investors “have been more than anxious to call a peak in prices,” and “the softer July headline is likely to perpetuate the notion that the worst of the cost pressures are now in the past,” said Lindsey Piegza and Lauren Henderson of Stifel Nicolaus & Co. But “the market has been violently (over) reacting to a single data point for some time now” and Fed policy makers need several months of significant price declines before becoming convinced that inflation is moving sustainably lower. After Wednesday’s CPI release, fed funds futures traders dropped their expectations for a 75 basis point rate increase by the Fed in September, to 37.5%, while boosting the likelihood of a smaller 50 basis point hike to 62.5%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. All three major U.S. indexes DJIASPXCOMP were higher into afternoon trading, with Dow industrials up by almost 500 points. Meanwhile, investors dove into bonds and sent most yields lower, led by declines in the 2-year BX:TMUBMUSD02Y and 3-year rates BX:TMUBMUSD03Y which reflect the expected policy path for the Fed in the next few years. The benchmark 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y fell to 2.76%.“The step down in core inflation is good news, but remember: We’ve been here before,” said Omair Sharif, founder and president of Inflation Insights. Following a burst of inflation in the second quarter of 2021, core inflation moderated sharply in the third quarter and then accelerated again in the fourth quarter, he wrote in a note. What’s more, a similar situation played out between January and June of this year, he said. “We’ve had headfakes before, so this is no time for complacency,” Sharif said in a note. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Safehold's stock was still inactive in the premarket. Under terms of the deal, each iStar share will have an implied value of $18.39, or 7.7% above Wednesday's closing price of $17.08. That would value iStar at about $1.57 billion, which compares with Safehold's market capitalization of $2.69 billion. As part of the deal, which is expected to close late in the fourth quarter of 2022 or in the first quarter of 2023, Safehold will internalize iStar's management team and intellectual property, Safehold will assume iStar's $100 million in L+150 trust preferred securities due 2035 and issue 1.2 million new Safehold shares to iStar.

2022-08-11 22:52:00,Market Extra: Financial market’s best inflation traders missed the downside surprises. Now they’re lowering 2022 expectations.,"<p>Getty Images/iStockphotoInflation has been nothing but full of surprises — remaining persistently hot for the past year when professional forecasters expected it to fade, then turning even lower than broadly expected for July. The consumer-price index report for last month, released on Wednesday, surprised to the downside — with an 8.5% annual headline rate below the 8.7% forecast of economists and the 8.8% level expected by inflation-derivatives traders. The pain of July’s downside miss was especially acute in the inflation-derivatives corner of the financial market, which has been used to being mostly spot-on about inflation since 2021 — considering millions of dollars can be made or lost on a single trade and the goal is to be precisely right.Now, traders of so-called CPI fixings are meaningfully lowering their inflation expectations for the next handful of months. On Thursday, they were pricing in annual headline CPI readings of 8.2% for August and September, down from 8.8% as of earlier this month. Their expectations for October’s reading have also dropped to 7.4%, versus 8% previously. And even the annual headline rate for December — which traders have been looking toward in order to gauge the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hikes — is expected to drift to less than 7%, leaving the rate below 2021’s year-end level.  July’s inflation drop “feels a little more sustainable,” said Gang Hu, a 20-year veteran of TIPS and fixings trader who is with New York-based hedge fund WinShore Capital Partners. Near-term inflation forecasting “has become a blind-leads-blind game, as many lead-lag relationships in inflation forecasting were broken” and “intrinsically, forecasting is much harder now.”Even before Wednesday’s CPI release, though, Hu had begun openly expressing more optimism to MarketWatch about inflation’s downward trajectory, based largely on the impact of falling gas prices. Thursday’s release of the July U.S. producer-price index, which registered its first negative monthly print since April 2020, only added to signs that inflation pressures are easing.“From a general anecdotal perspective, I don’t think prices are going to go up in the near term at the same speed as we used to have,” Hu said via phone on Thursday. “What gives me a little more conviction now that inflation could trend lower in the next two to three months is that housing and medical care services went down — and that could be a turning point.”Indeed, a wide swath of CPI categories, including used vehicles and apparel, also turned lower in July versus the prior month, though the most notable declines came in energy costs. Despite the softening price pressures, big-name firms like Pimco and BlackRock Inc. continued to express some worry after July’s CPI data, with Pimco economists saying the annual core measure which excludes food and energy “will likely reaccelerate in August, and isn’t likely to peak until September.”Read: Stock-market investors cheer July inflation data. Big-name firms like Pimco and BlackRock aren’t so sure.“I think the jury is still out,” said Tim Magnusson of Minnesota-based Garda Capital Partners, one of the few to anticipate inflation’s persistency last year.  July’s CPI number “was a clear miss to the downside, both versus economist expectations and market expectations.  We have not seen that in many months, and it must come as some relief to the Fed.  That said, there is still reason to believe we could drift higher again on future inflation prints, namely due to the stickiness of rents (OER) and the fact that energy has rebounded a bit.”The report represented a “substantial downside miss” within the fixings market “so if anyone was ‘long’ that fix, they lost money,” Magnusson wrote in an email to MarketWatch. That, he noted, demonstrates how “trading in the fixings cuts both ways.”On Thursday, U.S. stocks DJIASPXCOMP erased early gains to finish mostly lower as investors continued to react to the latest inflation development. Meanwhile,  10- and 30-year Treasury yields rose to their highest levels in three weeks as investors considered the possibility of a brighter economic outlook. “Medium term, say in the next five to six months, the whole story is that inflation isn’t over,” said Hu of WinShore Capital. “The inflation pressure we are witnessing in Europe, where one-year inflation expectations have moved 100 basis points higher, could have an impact in the U.S. And the longer term, say the next one to two years, is not so sure.”   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The report said that Apple also continues to expect suppliers to build about 220 million total iPhones for the year, which is roughly equal to last year's figure as well. Bloomberg noted that the report suggested confidence on the part of Apple executives that the company would be able to withstand economic challenges and still drive strong demand for its devices. Apple didn't immediately respond to MarketWatch's request for comment on its build requests. Chief Executive Tim Cook indicated on Apple's June-quarter earnings call that the smartphone giant had yet to see ""obvious evidence of macroeconomic impact,"" outside of negative effects related to currency movements. In contrast, he noted that the company did seem to be experiencing some macroeconomic pressure on the wearables, home, and accessories category.

2022-08-12 17:52:00,Market Extra: Stock-market euphoria meets bond-market pessimism as ‘strange week’ comes to end,"<p>Ben Stansall/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesIt’s been a head-scratching week in various asset classes — one that left investors and traders coming away with different conclusions about what lies ahead after data released showed U.S. inflation easing more than forecasters expected.Some are describing the stock market as “euphoric” about the possibility that the worst of inflation is behind: Major indexes continued to rebound strongly from their mid-June lows.  Oil futures remained on track for a weekly rise as fears of a sharp global slowdown eased in parts of the financial market. Meanwhile, the bond market has been flashing warnings of a possible economic downturn and more than half of the respondents in a BofA Securities FX and rates sentiment survey are concluding inflation will still require persistently tight policy, or more rate hikes. This time of the year is filled with summer vacations and is typically accompanied by a period of trading inactivity, which traditionally translates into what BMO Capital Markets strategists call “listless price action and limited volumes.” But this cycle is anything but typical, they said.“It has been a strange week for financial markets, filled with conflicting signals,”  Marios Hadjikyriacos, a senior investment analyst at Cyprus-based multi-asset brokerage firm XM, wrote in a note. Rather than definitively settle the debate on the path of inflation, Wednesday’s consumer-price index report, which showed the annual headline rate retreating to 8.5% in July, and Thursday’s producer-price data, which revealed the first negative monthly print since April 2020, ushered in more dialogue from policy makers on the continued need for higher interest rates.On Friday, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin said in a CNBC interview that while the inflation data was “welcome,” the Fed should still be raising its benchmark interest rate target until data show continuous progress. His remarks came as the  Cboe Volatility Index, otherwise known as the VIX VIX, or the stock market’s “fear gauge,” tumbled back below 20 for the first time since April.Read: Is the stock market’s favorite ‘fear gauge’ signaling more pain ahead for investors?Complicating the inflation outlook for some is that an argument can be made that not all price pressures are easing, despite growing signs of a turning point in inflation. According to Simon MacAdam, a senior global economist for Capital Economics, “red-hot” labor markets and elevated inflation expectations mean that “underlying sources of inflation remain intact.” There are “plenty of skeptics around who will punch that August is an euphoric overshoot” in equities, “giving the market the excuse to trade bad news is good and good news is also good,” said Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors in New York. “For those who think the market is a little too euphoric about peak inflation, the collapse in volatility presents attractive levels to buy puts.”Gold — which has generally underperformed as an inflation hedge this year,  though it should be benefiting from its status as a safe haven — swept to a fourth week in a row of price gains, the largest stretch since December, despite a post-CPI retreat on Thursday and earlier on Friday.In other post-CPI moves, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY fell off on Wednesday and Thursday even as long-term Treasury yields soared — when ordinarily they should be moving in tandem.  The divergent paths of the greenback and U.S. bond rates were significant enough to be singled out by XM’s  Hadjikyriacos.The cool down in both consumer and producer prices “sparked hopes that the worst days of inflation were behind us and the Fed wouldn’t need to be quite so aggressive in raising rates, dealing a blow to the US dollar,”  said the investment analyst.  “But the bond market refuses to endorse this narrative,”  Hadjikyriacos said, adding that long-dated yields are poised to end up for the week anyway on the view that a “trigger-shy Fed today could translate into higher inflation down the road.”In other words,  he said, “forex [foreign-exchange] traders focus on the near-term prospect of the Fed easing off the brakes whereas bond traders take a more holistic view that the inflation battle is not nearly over.” As of Friday afternoon, stocks were broadly higher, with Dow industrials DJIA up 0.8%, the S&amp;P 500 SPX  gaining 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP up by 1.5%. Treasury yields were mixed, keeping the spread between the 2- BX:TMUBMUSD02Y and 10-year rates BX:TMUBMUSD10Y deeply inverted at minus 39 basis points in a worrisome sign of the outlook.

For the week, the most-active contract gained 1.3% to clinch its longest stretch of weekly gains since Dec. 31, 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. A key focus of the week was U.S. consumer inflation data that showed signs of easing, while still extremely elevated at a 8.5% annual rate in July, versus 9.1% a month ago. The ICE US Dollar index  was up 0.5% on Friday against a basket of rival currencies, but was still headed for a roughly 0.9% weekly decline, according to FactSet data.

CEO Jamie Dimon said recently he sees a 20% to 30% chance of a ""harder recession"" and a 10% chance of a soft landing in the economy as the U.S. Federal Reserve hikes interest rates, according to a Saturday report from Yahoo Finance. Dimon reiterated his view that ""storm clouds"" remain on the economic horizon. He said he sees a 20% to 30% chance of ""something worse"" than a harder recession, but added it would be a mistake to pinpoint the exact probability. He expects the Fed's interest rate to rise to 4% by the end of the year from 2.4% now. The biggest complaint he hears from company leaders is they can't hire enough people. While company leaders say the prospects for their company are good, they also add that their confidence is low, ""because of inflation, because of partisan politics and a lot of leftover anger from COVID-19,"" Dimon said. Dimon's comments to wealthy clients in recent conversations were shared with the news service, which published a collection of his remarks. Shares of JPMorgan Chase are down 22.9% in 2022, compared to a 7.1% loss by the Dow Jones Industrial Average </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

""A booster dose of mRNA-1273.214 increased neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMT) against omicron approximately 8-fold above baseline levels,"" the company said in a statement.

Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share of 39 cents missed the FactSet EPS consensus of 79 cents. Gross margin contracted to 21.5% from 30.4%.

Higher pay for workers, increased headcount in distribution centers and costs of managing excess inventory also pressured margins. Total revenue grew 3.5% to $26.04 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $26.03 billion, while same-store sales growth of 2.6% was below expectations for a 2.8% rise.

2022-08-17 10:29:15,Coronavirus tally: Trial finds promising data from use of TB vaccine in protecting high-risk patients from COVID,"<p>Data from a trial seeking to determine whether multiple injections of a tuberculosis vaccine developed in the 1900s could protect high-risk diabetes patients from COVID produced some positive results, according to a New York Times report. The trial tracked COVID infections among a group of 144 participants all of whom had Type 1 diabetes, with two-thirds receiving at least 3 doses of BCG, or  Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin, shots, which protect people by bolstering the immune system. The results found just 1% of the 96 people who got the BCG shots developed COVID, while 12% of the placebo recipients got the virus. The data are still being evaluated. The move comes as U.S. known cases of COVID are continuing to ease, although the true tally is likely higher given how many people are testing at home, where the data are not being collected. The daily average for new cases stood at 100,747 on Tuesday, according to a New York Times tracker, down 18% from two weeks ago. Cases are falling in almost every state and are down 20% or more in more than a dozen states. The daily average for hospitalizations was down 45 at 41,668, while the daily average for deaths is up 4% to 467.  Globally, the confirmed case tally rose above 592.3 million on Tuesday, according to data aggregated by Johns 2Hopkins, while the death toll is above 6.44 million with the U.S. leading the world with 93.1 million cases and 1,037,970 deaths.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
