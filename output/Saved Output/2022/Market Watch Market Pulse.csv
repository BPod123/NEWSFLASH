Previously, the FDA had only authorized a booster for people aged 16 years and older. ""The booster vaccination increases the level of immunity and improves protection against COVID-19 across all age groups that have been authorized to receive one,"" said BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin. ""In the current situation, it is important to offer all eligible individuals a booster, particularly against the backdrop of the newly-emerging variants such as Omicron."" The FDA also reduced the time between getting the two-dose vaccine regimen and the booster shot to five months from six months. The FDA's EUA comes after ""real world evidence"" of more than 4.1 million booster doses administered given at least 5 months after the primary series of doses showed no new safety concerns in children 12 through 17 years of age. The news didn't help the companies' stocks, however, as shares of Pfizer dropped 3.7% in morning trading and BioNTech slumped 6.6%. Meanwhile, share of Moderna Inc.  sank 8.1% and Johnson & Johnson  slipped 0.4%, while the S&amp;P 500  rose 0.1%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

""We expect to report a very strong start to fiscal 2022 across-the-board, with first quarter revenue well above our guidance,"" Chief Executive Steve MacMillan said in a statement.

2022-01-10 16:04:00,"The Tell: Almost every Federal Reserve meeting in 2022 could be potentially `at play’ for a potential rate hike, Deutsche Bank says","<p>Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesFederal Reserve policy makers have been “way behind the curve” since early last year in tightening policy, and there’s now the possibility that they might need to consider hiking interest rates at almost every meeting in 2022, according to Deutsche Bank researchers.Deutsche Bank’s economists expect four hikes in 2022, starting in March, which is roughly in line with the market’s expectations, they wrote in a Monday note. They also foresee the reduction of the Fed’s more than $8 trillion balance sheet beginning in the third quarter, or after two rate hikes are delivered. Nonetheless, “unless financial conditions notably tighten then all seven meetings from March to the end of 2022 are now potentially in play,” wrote Deutsche Bank researchers, along with Jim Reid, head of thematic research. Concerns about Federal Reserve policy reverberated in financial markets on Monday, with U.S. stock indexes declining as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS economists raised their forecast for 2022 rate hikes, to four from three. Meanwhile, Treasury yields extended last week’s advance, which produced the biggest weekly gains in years, with the 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rising around 3 basis points to 1.8% in Monday morning trading.There’s growing agreement among economists that the central bank has waited too long to tackle persistent inflation — hamstrung by a more flexible approach to price gains just as the COVID-19 pandemic was unleashing surprisingly sustainable upward pressures. Now, policy makers are attempting to navigate what some refer to as a “dual” tightening, by shrinking their balance sheet along with hiking their policy rate target from its current level between 0% and 0.25%. If Fed officials were to actually deliver rate hikes at each one of their seven meetings between March and year-end, that would be about twice as many rate increases as traders currently expect. Investors are awaiting Tuesday’s re-confirmation hearing of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Wednesday’s release of the consumer-price index report. That report is expected to show a 7.1% headline year-over year figure for December, which would be the highest level in four decades.

2022-01-11 19:05:00,"The Tell: Here are the ETFs to buy on persistently higher inflation in 2022 and beyond, says BlackRock’s head of iShares strategy","<p>Nic Antaya/APGiven an outlook for high U.S. inflation that’s likely to persist beyond 2022, Gargi Chaudhuri of BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest asset manager, says investors should continue to hedge their portfolios with exchange-traded funds focused on inflation-linked bonds, commodities, infrastructure and real estate.Wednesday’s consumer-price report for December is likely to produce a headline year-over-year gain of more than 7%, the highest in almost 40 years, and to reflect a “broad-based” rise in inflation, Chaudhuri, head of iShares investment strategy for the Americas, wrote in a Tuesday note. Having a multiasset strategy is necessary in an environment in which inflation will probably settle above its pre-pandemic era levels “even after pandemic reopening effects have run their course.” The prospect of inflation that runs too hot for too long in the U.S. remained at the forefront on Tuesday, as lawmakers questioned the U.S. central bank’s ability to tackle price pressures during the confirmation hearing of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who has been nominated by President Joe Biden to serve a second term leading the institution.Investors took the testimony in stride, with Dow industrials DJIA, S&amp;P 500 SPX, and COMP all turning higher, though Treasury yields remained mixed.Sign up for our Market Watch Newsletters hereTraders foresee a total of three months of headline CPI readings that come in at or above 7%, including December’s, and don’t expect that measure to fall below 3% through November. Meanwhile, big names like JPMorgan Chase & Co’s JPM Jamie Dimon are expecting more than four rate increases from the Fed this year.“While we do not expect headline CPI inflation above 6% to persist over the medium term, we see room for inflation to settle at a higher level than the pre-pandemic era of sub-2% core inflation,” Chaudhuri wrote. “The continuation of powerful restart dynamics, more persistent supply chain challenges, strength in the all-important shelter inflation category of the CPI basket, and a savings-and wage-rich consumer will contribute to above-trend inflation.”She recommended that investors hedge by using ETFs managed by BlackRock such as: iShares 0-5 Year TIPS Bond ETF STIP; iShares TIPS Bond ETF TIP; iShares GSCI Commodity Dynamic Roll Strategy ETF COMT; iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF IFRA; and iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF IYR. Her recommendations are similar to those she gave in a December interview with Bloomberg TV, though at that time she said she expected inflation to moderate later in 2022.In Tuesday’s commentary, Chaudhuri also said she recommends stock investors “barbell their portfolio with value VLUE and quality factor oriented sectors QUAL of the market and focus on floating rate bonds FLOT in fixed income allocations.” She couldn’t immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.

Mollins said that while he believes Airbnb will prove the most resilient name in online travel for the foreseeable future, he expects the company's peers will see ""far greater"" gross book value (GBV) growth relative to pre-pandemic levels; many catalysts are either unlikely to come to fruition, such as increasing take rates on hosts and loyalty programs; and continued market pressure on growth names with inflation likely to persist in 2022. Mollins also sees an increased risk of ""material downward"" revenue revision in the first quarter as most of the omicron-related headwinds didn't emerge until the second half of December. The stock has dropped 4.8% over the past three months through Friday while the S&amp;P 500  has gained 3.9%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

A ""death cross"" appears when the 50-day moving average crosses (DMA) below the 200-DMA, which many chart watchers say marks the spot a short-term pullback graduates to a longer-term downtrend, but they're not always good market-timing tool given that their appearances are usually well telegraphed.

The COVID-19 vaccine provider's stock has plunged 31.6% during its losing streak, which is the longest since the biotechnology company went public in December 2018, and has plummeted 68.5% since its Aug. 9, 2021 post-pandemic peak of $484.47. The S&amp;P 500  has slipped 1.7% since Aug. 9. Papadakis raised his rating to hold, as the stock has more than halved in value since he started coverage of Moderna with a sell rating n Oct. 22, 2021, which resulted from a mixed financial update, ""somewhat underwhelming"" flu data and the expectation that the omicron variant will likely speed up the shift from pandemic to endemic, all at a time of rotation to value from growth in the broader stock market. He said that while he'll defer to stock market strategists on how long the rotation to value will continue, at current prices the stock valuation is ""more reasonable."" He trimmed his stock price target to $175 from $200, but the new target implies 14.7% upside from Tuesday's closing price of $152.54.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-01-26 17:42:31,UPDATE: At least 3 SPACs have withdrawn IPO plans in the last 24 hours amid highly volatile equity markets,"<p>At least four special-purpose acquisition corporations, or SPACs, have pulled their initial public offering plans in the past 24 hours, amid highly volatile equity markets. SPACs, also known as blank-check companies, are shell companies that raise money in an IPO and then acquire a business or businesses. The vehicle became popular during the pandemic, but many have struggled in the last year.  Do It Again Corp., a SPAC that was targeting a deal in the restaurant or food service sector, withdrew its registration early Wednesday. Murphy Canyon Acquisition Corp., which filed last June to raise $150 million in an IPO, withdrew its registration statement on Wednesday, and then said the withdrawal had been filed in error. Murphy Canyon had said it was seeking a target company in the real estate sector, ""including construction, homebuilding, real estate owners and operators, arrangers of financing, insurance, and other services for real estate, and adjacent businesses and technologies targeting the real estate space, which we may refer to as ""Proptech"" businesses."" Those moves came after CAVU Techology Acquisition Corp., which filed to raise up to $100 million in an IPO last March, also withdrew its registration statement. In its original filing, the company said it would target technology companies with an enterprise value of approximately $250 million to $500 million. Finally, TCG Growth Opportunities Corp., which filed for an IPO last March with plans to raise up to $250 million, also pulled its deal. The IPO market has gotten off to a weak start in 2022, with the Renaissance IPO ETF  down 24.6% in the year to date, while the S&amp;P 500  has fallen 9%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-01-27 20:15:00,": Federal Reserve’s rate-hike plans may be exacerbating the risk of a U.S. economic slowdown in 2022, based on bond-market signals","<p>Olivier Douliery/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesJust as Federal Reserve policy makers gear up for a likely series of interest rate hikes starting in March, the Treasury market is warning that there may be limits around how far policy makers can go without triggering fears of an impending recession.A day after the Fed’s policy update, the widely followed spread between 2- and 10-year Treasury yields shrank to  the narrowest level since November 2020, while the counterpart gap between 5- and 30-years flattened to a level not seen since January 2019, according to Tradeweb data as of 2 p.m. Eastern time Thursday. Parts of the government bond market also moved closer to inversion — such as the gap between 7- and 10-year Treasury rates.While the likelihood of at least five rate hikes by year-end has risen to more than 50% as of Thursday, there’s a distinction between what the market expects the Fed to do and what the market thinks the Fed can do without harming economic growth.Yield spreads that fall below zero are typically seen as a harbinger of an economic downturn. The last time the 2s10s spread went negative was in 2019. Months later, the U.S. economy fell into a two-month downturn that lasted from February 2020 to April of that year, driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.“We’re not anywhere near a massive inversion, but to me the signal from the curve tends to be a very good indicator of where we are headed,” said Societe Generale’s Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy. “The flattening curve has to be a concern because it raises the question of just how much the Fed will be able to hike in order to bring down inflation, without signaling risks of a recession.”Both the 2s10s and 5s30s spreads have already fallen sharply this year, even before the Fed has delivered its first rate hike. One big factor influencing the trajectory of long-term rates, and thus the flattening of the curve, is demand for Treasurys from overseas investors and domestic asset liability managers, Rajappa said.Meanwhile, other corners of the Treasury market, such as the gap between 20-year and 30-year yields, remain inverted at a time when forecasters expect the economy to be slowing.  The median estimate of economists polled by the Wall Street Journal this month is for GDP growth to slow to 3.3% in 2022, down from more than 5% in 2021, and to continue slowing to 2.4% and 2.2% in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Economists at the American Bankers Association are also bracing for a U.S. slowdown over much of this year, while the International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for global growth in 2022, to 4.4% from a previously expected 4.9%. Read: Hidden in the GDP report is proof that the air is already coming out of the economyFor his part, Powell told reporters on Wednesday that many factors are influencing longer-term interest rates, and that the central bank does “monitor the slope of the yield curve, but we don’t control the slope of the yield curve.” “I don’t think of it as some kind of an iron law,” he said. “But we do look at it and try to understand the implications and what it’s telling us. And it’s one of many things that we monitor.”During Powell’s prepared remarks on Wednesday, the bond market began to price in higher inflation expectations, as reflected in the 10-year TIPS breakeven rate, on the view that the Fed would be adopting  “a more measured approach” to removing accommodation than previously thought, Rajappa said. But as Powell’s comments turned decidedly more hawkish during the question-and-answer session, the market walked back, leaving expectations at roughly where they were before Wednesday, she said.On Thursday, most Treasury yields turned lower, except for the 1- and 2-year rates BX:TMUBMUSD02Y, which rose by 15 and 12 basis points, respectively, to 0.73% and 1.19%. The 10- BX:TMUBMUSD10Y and 30-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD30Y each fell,  as major stock indexes were mixed.Sign up for our Market Watch Newsletters here</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The Treasury yield curve, for example, has flattened substantially since the start of the year — a warning that there may be limits to how far policy makers can go without triggering fears of an impending recession.  “Aggressive Fed tightening should affect the economy with a lag, weighing on 2023 growth,” Harris and the others wrote. They see the fed funds rate target ultimately ending up in a range between 2.75% and 3%, versus its current level of zero to 0.25%. The economists said they are making “wholesale revisions” to their economic and monetary policy outlook for 2022 and 2023, and that “an even faster-than-expected drop in unemployment and longer-than-expected supply disruptions mean more inflation.”Read:  U.S. inflation leaps 5.8% in 2021, PCE shows, and hits 40-year highTo be sure, BofA’s seven-rate-hike call for 2022 isn’t universally shared just yet. Fed funds futures are pointing to a more than 50% likelihood that the central bank will hike rates by 25 basis points at least five times this year, but the probability of seven hikes was only 6% as of Friday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.Harris couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.On Friday, most Treasury yields headed lower as U.S. consumer sentiment slumped to a decade low and inflation concerns mount.

Wallace IV on Monday downgraded shares of ConnectOne Bancorp  to outperform from strong buy and trimmed his price estimate by $2 to $38 a share following the company's fourth-quarter results. ""Assuming net interest margin has likely peaked, it will become a headwind as the Fed starts rising rates when the bulk of the industry anticipates margin tailwinds as we head into a rising rate environment,"" Wallace said. ""We anticipate investors may struggle to get comfortable investing aggressively in a bank that is facing pressure where most are experiencing tailwind."" On the plus side, ConnectOne's fee income could allow it to offset pressure on net interest margin, he said. Shares of ConnectOne fell 3% on Monday, compared to a rise of 0.7% by the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-01-31 20:46:00,The Fed: Fed’s Barkin says pace of coming rate hikes depends on pace of inflation,"<p>The pace of coming interest rate hikes will depend on the pace of inflation, said Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin on Monday. “I’d like us to be in a better position — somewhere closer to neutral certainly than we are now. And I think the pace of that just depends on inflation,” Barkin said, in an interview with CNBC. Barkin indicated he was not in a rush, saying the Fed has a “good part of the year” to get closer to neutral. Inflation on the cost of goods is likely to come down as supply chain bottlenecks ease, Barkin said. Consequently, it will be key to watch if wage pressures boost service sector inflation. “Obviously demand is going to play a big part of that,” he said.  Barkin dismissed concerns over the flattening of the yield curve. “There is just a lot of global money that trades at the longer-end of the yield curve,  BX:TMUBMUSD10Yand I have a hard time making much out of it, in that context,” he said.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Over the weekend, Bostic’s discussion of a half-point hike with the Financial Times garnered a lot of market attention. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Bostic clarified that a half-point hike “is not my preferred setting of policy action at the next meeting.” Bostic said he expects three quarter-point rate hikes this year. The discussion about a more aggressive hike was meant to show that he is keeping his options open, he added. “I’m going to let the data and the evidence really guide us,” Bostic said. The Atlanta Fed president said he thought the Fed could start to shrink its balance sheet after the central bank has hiked rates a “few” times. “Let’s get a few of our interest rate moves in order to see how the economy is responding,” he said. Once the reduction has started, Bostic said he thought Fed could shrink its portfolio at a faster pace than in 2017-2019. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-02-01 11:37:55,European gas futures prices fall as Russia reportedly increases supplies,"<p>Natural gas prices tumbled on Tuesday, after Russia reportedly boosted supply flow through Ukraine. Natural gas on the Dutch-based TTF trading hub tumbled 10% to 75.85 euros a megawatt-hour. Rising prices over the past year have seen those futures climb nearly 200 euros a megawatt-hour, amid an energy crisis that has weighed on Europe in the past several months and which was not helped by tensions between the West and Russia over the latter's potential invasion of Ukraine. A March U.K. natural-gas prices contract  was down 11% to 180 pence a therm. The higher supplies came amid a reported resumption of normal levels for Russian deliveries into Slovakia at a point that borders Ukraine.

2022-02-01 21:54:00,"Market Extra: As Fed sets stage for March rate hike, stock-market investors face ‘perilous’ backdrop of higher volatility","<p>Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesInvestors, particularly those reliant on computer-generated decisions to buy or sell, face a treacherous backdrop of volatility driven by the Federal Reserve, following a brutal month of stock trading. January’s violent moves in equities offer a glimpse of what might still be in store: The S&amp;P 500SPX and Nasdaq CompositeCOMP indexes finished the month with their biggest percentage declines since March 2020, while the Dow Jones Industrial AverageDJIA staged an unprecedented 1,214-point reversal in a single day last week. Meanwhile, two- and five-year Treasurys, with rates reflecting the short- to intermediate-term path of Fed policy, are off to their worst start to a new year in more than three decades, according to Dow Jones Market Data. At issue is uncertainty over just how far the central bank is willing to go to tackle the highest U.S. inflation in almost 40 years, starting with a widely anticipated rate hike in March, investors and strategists say. That uncertainty is, ironically, giving way to at least one area of greater clarity: Big market swings are probably here to stay.“Volatility is probably the only thing that my compliance department would allow me to guarantee,” said John Lynch, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management, which oversees $175 billion in assets. “It could be 15 to 18 months until we get full clarity on the extent of Fed tightening, and the market is susceptible to further bouts until then.” Meanwhile, “investors need to be prepared for more equity-market volatility, and those caught up in quant or algorithmic trading may get hurt,” he said via phone Tuesday.Complicating the Fed’s task ahead is a pair of competing forces: One is the likelihood of no near-term letup in inflation, given signs of building price pressures from factors unrelated to U.S. labor and supply shortages. They include strong demand for merchandise and drought conditions outside the U.S. that are driving up the price of commodities like soybeans. The other force is worries about a potential economic slowdown — as flagged by the International Monetary Fund in January, and the Treasury market, which has flashed repeated warnings about the growth outlook since October. While many say higher inflation makes the case in favor of more aggressive Fed rate hikes, the prospect of a downturn supports the view that inflation could subside and policy makers need to be more cautious about tightening — which, together, are generating even more volatility for financial markets.The Fed will be “hard-pressed” to lift the fed-funds rate target to its long-run objective of 2.5%, from a current level between 0% and 0.25%, and is more likely to get no higher than 1.5% to 2%, according to Comerica’s Lynch. Despite growing expectations that the Fed could deliver a half-point hike in March, a nonfarm payrolls report that comes below expectations for February might be enough to remove that option, he said.Add to this environment a continuing debate about the degree to which shrinking the Fed’s nearly $9 trillion balance sheet will tighten financial conditions, or could act as a substitute for rate hikes–a process that some have dubbed as “dual tightening.” Read: What to expect from markets in the next six weeks, before the Federal Reserve revamps its easy-money stanceIn a BofA Global Research note Monday, strategists Andy Pham and Francisco Blanch, along with analyst Chintan Kotecha, wrote that “with risks tilted asymmetrically higher and all but confirmed by the Fed following the January meeting, we think quant investors should brace for a higher vol environment.” They said they see the backdrop as “perilous,” but say that “pockets of alpha can still be found across commodity and FX risk premia.”Quantitative systems have been used in recent years as a way to beat the market and post solid returns, while high-frequency trading algorithms have helped to make trading cheaper for many and account for a large portion of the buying and selling of U.S. shares that take place.U.S. stock benchmarks shook off a tentative start by late Tuesday, with the Dow industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all posting gains. Meanwhile, Treasury yields were also higher, with the 10- BX:TMUBMUSD10Y and 30-year rates BX:TMUBMUSD30Y having their biggest advances in almost a week.“We’re going to see increased volatility among asset classes, and it’s very possible that quant investors would get hit hardest,” said Calvin Norris, portfolio manager and U.S. rates strategist at Aegon Asset Management in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which oversees $463.8 billion. “I do agree that it will be a long time before we alleviate a lot of the factors causing inflation, and there’s some reason to believe we’re going to see a tailwind from inflation for some time.”“The pace of Fed rate hikes and the pace of balance sheet runoff, we don’t know. So at this point, the market is left to its own imagination and can spin a hawkish or dovish story for itself,” he said via phone.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

In particular, Krinsky noted that the percentage of S&amp;P 500 components that have been trading below their 200-day moving average (DMA), which many view as a dividing line between longer-term uptrends and downtrends, ahs been below 55% for most of the days for the past six weeks. ""This needs to change for the trend to change,"" Krinsky wrote in a note to clients. Currently, 230 S&amp;P 500 components, or 45.5%, are trading below their 200-DMA. ""While select pockets of strength persist, the surge in commodity prices along with widening credit spreads and lack of breadth improvement suggest we have yet to see a final capitulation event,"" Krinsky wrote. He believes the S&amp;P 500 could fall below 4,000 before the correction runs its course. The top of the downtrend channel Krinsky referred to is about 1.8% above current levels, while 4,000 is about 8.8% below. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Flynn believes the Biden administration is desperate to do a deal with Venezuela because supplies of diesel fuel are at historically low levels.

2022-03-15 18:54:00,"Market Extra: A fresh part of the Treasury yield curve is inverting, ahead of the Fed’s rate decision. Here’s why.","<p>Stefani Reynolds/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesA part of the Treasury yield curve has been inverting since Friday during the run-up to this week’s Federal Reserve’s policy decision, and traders are chalking up the development to a simple technicality. The 7-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD07Y has traded above the 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y largely because of a move known as “convexity hedging,” said Michael Franzese, a fixed income trader for MCAP.  Dealers and market makers who are holding and selling mortgage-backed securities need to compensate for the risks of managing those loans by selling Treasurys when yields rise, as they have over recent days. He called the inversion a “one-off” development that won’t necessarily spread across the rest of the Treasury curve “unless the economy stalls and/or the Fed is not prepared to stop tightening when the market thinks is sufficient.” It’s the more widely followed spread between the 2-year BX:TMUBMUSD02Y and 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, hovering below 30 basis points as of Tuesday, that most have their eye on. A drop below zero in the 2s/10s spread is often regarded as a harbinger of a recession. The following table shows the inversion of the 7y/10y spread, which occurred on Friday. Prior to Friday, the last time the spread had inverted was on March 9, 2020, when COVID-19 fears sent U.S. stocks plummeting. The 7y/10y hasn’t stayed consistently inverted since at least 2009, according to Derek Tang, an economist at Monetary Policy Analytics in Washington.Dow Jones Market Data</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-03-15 18:35:00,Market Extra: How details on shrinking Fed’s almost $9 trillion balance sheet might shake up markets more than a rate hike on Wednesday,"<p>Stefani Reynolds/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesThere’s the potential for a bigger market-moving development from the Federal Reserve than its widely expected quarter percentage point interest rate hike on Wednesday: fresh information about policy makers’ plans for reducing their almost $9 trillion balance sheet. B. of A. strategists Mark Cabana and Katie Craig, along with portfolio manager Thomas Graff of Brown Advisory, are among those who see a likelihood that policy makers could produce new details on efforts to reduce the size of their portfolio. And that would come as a surprise to many in financial markets, who aren’t expecting the central bank to update its so-called “quantitative tightening” plans just yet. The highest U.S. inflation rate in 40 years is putting pressure on the Fed to act, while the Russia-Ukraine conflict is adding downside risks to the economy and the outlook. A sooner-than-expected effort to jump start the process of shrinking the Fed’s portfolio would be seen as one way to deliver tighter financial conditions and a response to high inflation, while avoiding larger-than-normal rate hikes of more than a quarter  point at a time. Read:How the Federal Reserve could cut its near $9 trillion balance sheet as it fights inflation “Any announcement on the balance sheet would certainly have a signaling effect,” Graff said via phone Tuesday. “If they were to give us a pretty definitive guide on the balance sheet Wednesday, that would tell us they are trying to be as aggressive as they can be. This would be the way they could send a message beyond the action of rate hikes.”Such a message would be interpreted by financial markets as a “very hawkish sign” that leads to a ” `sell everything’ market,’ ” he said. “Short-term yields would have to rise a good bit and the whole curve would sell off pretty strongly,” and possibly spreading into other asset classes, like stocks. To be sure, central bank policy makers aren’t expected to actually start shrinking their portfolio this week, but signaling how they might begin to go about the process has the potential to catch traders off guard in much the same way that minutes of the December meeting did when they were released on Jan. 5. That’s when policy makers revealed that they had a lengthy discussion about reducing their balance sheet. The minutes helped push the 10-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y to what was then the highest level since April 2021, and sent the 2-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y to an almost two-year high.In a note released Monday, BofA’s Cabana and Craig said that  while Fed officials are unlikely to explicitly state when they’ll begin quantitative tightening, “we may get further clarity as to how much the current geopolitical tensions in Ukraine are weighing on that decision.”“Our base case is that the Fed will both announce and implement QT in May,” though the risks are skewed to June or July, they wrote. They also said that policy makers are unlikely to actively sell assets and will instead “rely mostly on passive redemptions to manage their balance sheet lower.”Traders of fed funds futures are currently pricing in a 98% chance of a 25 basis point hike on Wednesday. They also see a better than 50 percent chance the Fed delivers the equivalent of at least seven 25 basis point rate hikes this year, which would lift the Fed’s policy rate target to at least 1.75% to 2%, or higher, from a current level of 0% to 0.25%, based on the CME FedWatch Tool. Yet that’s still far behind where some say the target should already be for the Fed to demonstrate seriousness about fighting inflation.Neither the Fed nor many in the market are confident about what sort of impact a shrinking balance sheet might have on rates. However, an expanding balance sheet appears correlated to higher global equity levels, according to B. of A. rates strategist Ralph Axel.  BofA Global ResearchJPMorgan Chase & Co.’s JPM Michael Feroli said the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will likely spend some of its two-day meeting “tying up some QT loose ends.” “If they make progress in those discussions, we would expect them to convey that either in an addendum to the statement or in the opening remarks of Powell’s press conference,” Feroli wrote in a note last week. “Chair Powell’s post-meeting press conference would be the natural venue to provide any more details on plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet, such as the size of the monthly runoff caps, the duration of the phase-in period for those caps, and the conditions that will warrant the eventual start of the process.”  As of Tuesday afternoon, selling of Treasurys resumed, sending yields back up again ahead of Wednesday’s FOMC decision. The 10-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rose above 2.1% in afternoon trading.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-03-17 16:32:00,Market Extra: Bond market is skeptical of Fed’s `wishful thinking’ on at least 10 quarter-point rate hikes through 2023,"<p>Saul Loeb/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesBond traders are doubtful about the Federal Reserve’s ability to deliver a total of at least 10 quarter-point rate hikes in the next two years without substantially undermining U.S. economic growth and employment. Treasury yields fell across the curve on Thursday — with some of the biggest declines coming in 1- and 2-year maturities. One BX:TMUBMUSD01Y to two year BX:TMUBMUSD02Y yields would ordinarily be moving higher in response to confirmation of a more hawkish Fed. Instead, Thursday’s rally in government bonds, which pushed yields down, reflects a flight-to-quality move by investors and the market’s latest view that the U.S. is heading for lower growth, observers say.Thursday’s broad-based drop in yields was accompanied by a U.S. stock market struggling for direction earlier on Thursday, before all three major benchmarks DJIASPXCOMP bounced back in the afternoon. “Definitely, the market is questioning the optimistic scenario laid out in the Summary of Economic Projections, in which rate hikes do not have an impact on employment and growth,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York.Policy makers’ forecasts, which call for a total of seven quarter-point hikes in 2022 and three to four more next year, “are orchestrated for a soft landing,” she said via phone. “But it’s a bit of wishful thinking to think there will be no impact on employment, given how hawkish the Fed might be on rate hikes. Either the Fed isn’t able to deliver that many hikes, or it delivers that many hikes and that leads to a much more dramatic slowdown in growth and rise in the unemployment rate.”Wednesday’s aggressive flattening of the Treasury yield curve took a bit of a breather on Thursday, with the spread between the 2- and 10-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y hovering below 23 basis points, one of the lowest levels since March 2020. The widely followed spread has plummeted from as high as 1.6 percentage points last March, and traders remain on guard for the prospect that it might fall below zero soon,  an inversion which typically signals an impending recession. Meanwhile, the probability of stagflation across the globe is turning into what Barclays PLC UK:BARC strategists Maneesh S. Deshpande, Japinder Chawla and Stefano Pascale are calling “a non-trivial possibility.”“The curve movement is the most compelling part of what’s happened over recent days because that’s where recession risks start to show up,” Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist for RBC Capital Markets in New York, said via phone. “The market is priced for seven hikes this year, based on fed funds futures. So the flattening of the yield curve suggests that maybe the Fed does what it says it will do, but that comes with a risk, which is some slowing economic activity.” If  Fed officials hike rates according to their projections, they would be pushing the fed funds rate target up to 2.8% by the end of 2023, from 0.25% to 0.5% currently. That would be the highest level since 2008.In the process of delivering 10 to 11 quarter-point hikes over the next two years, policy makers anticipate U.S. economic growth will come in at 2.8% for 2022 before slipping down to 2.2% by the end of 2023. Their projections also assume the unemployment rate  will stay roughly constant — 3.5% in 2022 and 2023, and 3.6% in 2024 — while inflation drops toward more normal levels below 3% starting next year.“Investors are skeptical that the Fed can achieve a soft landing,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “The markets continue to digest the implications of yesterday’s Fed move,”  he wrote in an emailed note Thursday, “as the Fed moves from one horn of the dilemma (behind the inflation curve) to the other horn (recession fears).”      </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-03-22 15:37:03,"Tesla stock up as Elon Musk cuts ribbon on Berlin Gigafactory expected to produce 500,000 vehicles a year","<p>Tesla Inc. shares  rose 2% Tuesday, as Chief Executive Elon Musk cut the ribbon on the company's first manufacturing facility in Europe, its 5.5 billion euro ($5.5 billion) Gigafactory in Berlin. The plant is based in Gruenheide, a coal town that sits within commuting distance of the German capital. Musk did a dance as he oversaw the delivery of the first German-made Tesla vehicles to 30 clients and their families, CNBC reported. The ceremony was also attended by protesters, who are concerned at the high amount of water it will use and the number of trees that were felled to build it. The factory is expected to produce up to 500,000 electric cars a year. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a Tesla bull, said the Berlin plant is ""one of the biggest strategic endeavors for Tesla over the last decade and should further vault its market share within Europe over the coming years as more consumers aggressively head down the EV path."" In a note to clients published Monday, Ives said the decision by the German authorities to clear the plant to start production removes a major overhang on the stock for the past few months. ""We cannot stress the production importance of Giga Berlin to the overall success of Tesla's footprint in Europe and globally, as the current Rubik's Cube logistics of producing cars in China at Giga Shanghai and delivering to customers throughout Europe was not a sustainable trend,"" the analyst wrote. Wedbush has an outperform rating on Tesla stock and a 12-month price target of $1,400 that is about 58% above its current price. Tesla shares have gained 40% in the last 12 months, but are down about 11% in 2022 to date, while the S&amp;P 500  has fallen 6%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Truist maintained its $40 price target. ""As we move into 2022 and a new normal, we would expect a slowdown in the coffee segment,"" analysts wrote in their note.

2022-03-23 15:12:00,Currencies: The Japanese yen continues to fall after hitting 6-year low against U.S. dollar following hawkish Fed remarks,"<p> Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP via Getty ImagesThe Japanese yen is taking a hit from hawkish remarks by Federal Reserve policy makers this week, extending its weakness against the U.S. dollar for a fourth straight session.Japan’s currency was trading at around 121 yen per dollar USDJPY as of Wednesday, a day after the Asian currency weakened to a six-year low against the greenback. The chart below captures this week’s selloff, and illustrates how much the yen has depreciated against the dollar in just the past three days. The yen has fallen versus the greenback by more than 5% this month.Source: FactSetRemarks by Loretta Mester, head of the Fed’s regional bank in Cleveland, have the potential to further extend the yen’s decline against the dollar, according to Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. On Wednesday, Mester said she presumes that policy makers will need to do “some” 50 basis point rate increases this year. Her comments come just two days after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank could deliver rate increases of larger than 25 basis points each at future meetings.“A consensus is being formed at the Fed for a 50 basis point rate hike in May, and the market continues to press for a pain threshold for the yen. Wherever it is, we haven’t gotten to it yet,” Chandler said via phone. “The yen is still taking it on the chin and bearing the brunt of Powell’s comments, which have lit the dollar.” The prospect of higher interest rates in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world tends to push the dollar and Treasury yields higher, particularly against a country like Japan where policy makers are keeping ultra-easy monetary policy in place.The Bank of Japan, unlike much of the rest of the world, is grappling with weak price pressures: It still sees inflation remaining short of its 2% target even though consumer expectations hit a record high this month. Last week, policy makersmaintained their target for short-term interest rates at minus 0.1% and their target for the 10-year Japanese government-bond yield at around zero.Read:BOJ’s Kuroda says it’s still too early to discuss exit from monetary easingThe BOJ’s yield curve control “appears to be acting as a brake,” B. of A. rate strategists Tomonobu Yamashita and Shusuke Yamada wrote in a note on Wednesday. However, the risks for Japanese yields are “skewed to the upside” and the 10-year yield on the Japanese government bond could rise to 0.4% by year-end, from a current level around 0.2%, if Japan’s central bank adjusts its yield-curve control target and exits its negative interest rate policy, they said.On Wednesday, Treasury yields edged off their 2019 highs, with the 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y around 2.4%, while the U.S. Dollar Index DXY was up 0.2%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

All six of the gauges used to monitor U.S. Treasury market depth — or the ease with which securities can be bought and sold without significantly impacting their prices — have remained at abnormal conditions for the month of March, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s JPM Liquidity Stress Dashboard. This was the case before Friday’s broad, aggressive selloff in Treasurys — which sent 2- BX:TMUBMUSD02Yand 10-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y to their biggest weekly gains since June 2009 and September 2019, respectively. Yields and prices move in opposite directions — so soaring yields reflect a drop in demand and prices on Treasurys.Source: JPMorgan Chase & Co. The decline in Treasury market depth has corresponded with the recent substantial rise in yields as investors factor in the Fed’s first quarter percentage point rate increase since 2018 and the likelihood of possibly bigger moves to come. The biggest driver behind the market’s illiquidity is the narrative of a U.S. central bank “pushing rates higher,” according to JPMorgan rates strategist Alex Roever. “We’ve had conditions for several months where cash market depths have been low, and part of that is because of rates backing up and being very sensitive to the Fed and inflation news,” Roever said via phone Friday. “That means it can be very painful to hold bonds and, in aggregate, it feels like we’re not seeing as many end users buy Treasurys bonds as we have before, with demand lower.”JPMorgan’s dashboard captures more than two dozen different gauges of market conditions, most of them in the Treasurys market. In total, 10 of the gauges being monitored were flashing either a “RED” or “Amber” status as of Thursday, before Friday’s market action. On Friday, two- BX:TMUBMUSD02Y and 10-year Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y climbed to their highest levels since May 6, 2019, while the spread between 5- BX:TMUBMUSD05Yand 30-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD30Y teetered on the brink of inversion.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

""Plummeting returns at the end of 2021 effectively put an end to the past year's IPO boom, and coupled with the escalating war in Europe, issuance ground to a halt in late February,"" Renaissance, a provider of institutional research and IPO ETFs, said in commentary. There were just seven IPOs that raised more than $50 million in the period, led by TPG's billion-dollar deal, which accounted for nearly half of overall proceeds. The private-equity firm went public in January some 30 years after it launched under the name Texas Pacific Group. Much of the market activity involved microcaps, causing the median deal size to fall to $27 million, the lowest in at least two decades. ""IPOs averaged a 33% return, driven by explosive first-day pops from volatile small issuers and decent returns from larger ones,"" said Renaissance. ""The Renaissance IPO Index  had its worst quarter since 2011 with a 25% drop, well below the S&amp;P 500's loss."" The special purpose acquisition corporation market also ran out of steam, with an almost 70% decline in pricings from the fourth quarter and a rise in deal withdrawals, redemption rates and merger terminations. The outlook for the second quarter is ""foggy"" and risk appetite will need to return before activity is likely to resume. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-03-30 20:28:00,": Federal Reserve’s projected rate hikes ‘won’t sufficiently tame’ inflation, Credit Suisse says","<p>Mario Tama/Getty ImagesU.S. inflation, already at a 40-year high, is likely to remain hot even after the Federal Reserve completes all 10 to 11 of its projected quarter-point rate hikes through the end of next year, according to Credit Suisse research analysts. In a note on Tuesday, Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist and head of quantitative research, and others said that while the Fed’s projected rate hikes “might appear restrictive, they are unlikely to sufficiently tame the current torrid pace of inflation.” “Put differently, not only is the rate too low today, but it will likely be too low even after the Fed completes its projected rate hikes,” they wrote.The Credit Suisse CS  analysts highlighted a well-known formula for monetary policy known as the “Taylor Rule,” which acts as a rule of thumb or guide for where the Fed’s main policy rate ought to be relative to inflation, output, and/or the state of the economy. The formula would imply a fed funds rate target of 9.8%, according to Credit Suisse. That compares with its current level between 0.25% and 0.5%, which is projected to get to just 2.8% by the end of next year. The chart below shows how far off policy makers are from the Taylor Rule. The addition of half-point rate hikes would help bring them closer, but would still leave policy extremely accommodative.Source: Federal Reserve, Bloomberg, Credit SuisseForecasters can come away with vastly different conclusions about interest rates after using the Taylor Rule, particularly if they use different projections for inflation and growth in output. And the rule serves only as a recommendation. In Golub’s mind, inflation is likely to stay persistently high throughout the current recovery. The annual headline U.S. inflation rate is already at its highest since 1982, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and other officials have raised the prospect of hiking rates by a larger-than-normal, half-point increment to combat price gains. “The increments of rate hikes wouldn’t change the underlying question, which is: ‘Where is the terminal rate and why wouldn’t we move toward that terminal rate more quickly?” Golub said via phone. Fed policy makers could theoretically shift to a string of 50 basis point moves, “but even so, we would still be too low over the near term.”“The real question is, ‘What is the level of interest rates that would cause the economy to face a headwind?’ ” he said. “If we take two years to get there and move too slowly, you’re effectively adding stimulus.” On Wednesday, investors returned to buying Treasuries, sending the benchmark 10-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD10Y down to below 2.4% and yields lower across the curve.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-04-08 04:06:24,U.S. average life expectancy falls for second consecutive year,"<p>The average life span in the U.S. fell in 2021 for a second consecutive year, compounding the effect of a decline in 2020 that was the largest since 1943. Preliminary data, NPR reported citing a new analysis, show the average U.S. life span contracting by just under a half-year in 2021, after a nearly two-year decline in 2020, the first year of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, when vaccines were not yet widely available. Prior to 2020, life expectancy in the U.S. had been on an effectively uninterrupted climb for generations. Princeton University demographer Noreen Goldman called it shameful ""how poorly [the U.S. has] come through this pandemic."" Goldman joined Steven Woolf, a professor of population health and health equity at Virginia Commonwealth University, who participated in the analysis, in pointing to vaccine hesitancy and resistance to such public health measures as masking as factors in the 2021 life-span decline.

2022-04-08 18:04:00,"Market Extra: U.S. recession indicator is `not flashing code red’ yet, says pioneering yield-curve researcher","<p>Duke University’s Campbell Harvey.Amid the fierce debate over whether the U.S. is about to head into an economic downturn, the Duke University finance professor who pioneered the use of bond-market yield curves as a predictive tool has a few things to say.One is that it’s too soon to say whether a contraction is on the way, though the world’s largest economy appears poised for a slowdown, according to Campbell Harvey, whose 1986 dissertation at the University of Chicago determined that the difference between long- and short-term interest rates was linked to future U.S. growth. Moreover, he says, the recent brief inversion of the 2-year, 10-year Treasury spread needs to persist for three months to provide a meaningful signal.“Everything is pointing to slower economic growth,”  said Harvey, a 63-year-old, Canadian-born economist. Referring to the narrowing of spreads between long- and short-term rates seen in various parts of the Treasury market in recent months, he says that “any flattening is likely associated with slower U.S. economic growth. And it’s reasonable to expect flattening across the whole curve, given the Fed is in a tightening cycle.” “When it comes to the slope of the yield curve, flat is bad and inverted is really bad,” he told MarketWatch in a phone interview on Thursday. “And right now, the yield curve is not flashing code red for a recession.”Ordinarily in a healthy economy, yields and their spreads steepen as investors price in brighter growth prospects well into the future, causing the Treasury curve to slope upward.  Conversely, spreads flatten when the outlook is more pessimistic, and can even fall below zero and invert.Historically speaking, the curve doesn’t typically approach zero until rate hikes by the Federal Reserve are well under way. This time around, though, a handful of spreads are inverted while others are teetering on the brink at a time when the Fed has delivered only one quarter-point rate increase, though policy makers are poised to deliver more hikes. In particular, the widely followed spread between 2- BX:TMUBMUSD02Y and 10-year Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y has flattened at a faster speed than any other time since the 1980s, even before the Fed’s quarter-point hike on March 16. It fell below zero on March 29 and stayed inverted for just a few days — triggering a debate over its usefulness as a recessionary signal. It was the spread’s first inversion since Aug. 30, 2019 — which preceded a two-month downturn in 2020.Gargi Chaudhuri, head of iShares Investment Strategy for the Americas at BlackRock Inc. BLK, said in a note on Friday, “We do not see a recession occurring in the near-term.” Her remarks came a day after policy maker James Bullard of the St. Louis Fed said officials can substantially raise rates without hurting the economy.  Former U.S. Treasury SecretaryLawrence Summers, on the other hand, told Bloomberg Television he expected economists to come around to a consensus view that a U.S. recession in the next couple of years  “is clearly more likely than not.”Economic downturns tend to follow a 2s/10s inversion with a lag of roughly 20 months, and in some cases more than two years. Such an inversion can also impact the psychology of companies, making them more reluctant to spend. But there’s one extremely important caveat, said Duke’s Harvey: “An inversion needs to last for a quarter — a day or a week just isn’t meaningful — and that’s not happened.” He credited the speed of the 2s/10s flattening since  November to “a miscalibration of people’s inflation expectations,” and not necessarily a sign that a deeper inversion is on the way.Like other high-profile economists, such as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, Harvey pointed to the shortest end of the Treasury market — the bills sector — as the starting point for a more relevant indication of where the economy may be heading. The spread between rates on the three-month bill BX:TMUBMUSD03M and 10-year note is still more than 200 basis points — suggesting to some that economic growth can continue. Like its 2s10s counterpart, the 3m/10y spread also inverted in  2019, ahead of the February-April 2020 recession driven by pandemic-related closures. Even though the 3m/10y spread is positively sloped, “it’s reasonable to suspect there will be substantial flattening over the next year,” Harvey said.“Economic theory is clear: What you care about is where growth will be, starting from now,” he said. “And for that, you need to anchor it to the short-term yield. Given expectations for Fed rate hikes, it’s reasonable to think that the 3-month rate is going up.”The 3-month bill, now hovering around 0.68%, only reflects Fed hikes that have actually been delivered — whereas the 2-year rate, at around 2.5%, captures expectations for future rate increases. Many observers say the central bank is now far behind the curve when it comes to tackling inflation.Read:  Opinion: It’s now clear that the Federal Reserve has made a huge monetary-policy errorComplicating the economic outlook is an issue that hasn’t received nearly as much attention as the yield curve, inflation, or the prospect of more Fed rate hikes: The federal-debt-to-GDP ratio, which was more than 100% at the end of last year.When rates rise, so does the U.S.’s debt-service payments which, in turn, will boost the size of the government’s deficit, according to Harvey. “The Fed will need to take that into account. What is the implication if we push rates up? Ultimately, the Fed’s goal is to get inflation under control in a way that doesn’t damage employment — a soft landing. That task is highly complicated and the fact that debt-to-GDP is so high makes this a much more challenging problem.” On Friday, Treasurys sold off across the board, pushing the 10-year yield above 2.7%. The 2s/10s spread toggled between steepening and flattening during the day as investors continued to assess the Fed’s most likely policy path. Meanwhile, major stock indexes were mixed, with Dow industrials DJIA up more than 150 points in the afternoon and the S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq Composite COMP both lower.  </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-04-08 16:22:26,New York State to allow state tax deductions for legal cannabis companies,"<p>Legal cannabis companies would be allowed for the first time to deduct ordinary business expenses on their state taxes under a budget agreement reached Thursday by New York State lawmakers. This would put cannabis companies on equal tax ground with all other businesses in the state, at least in terms of their New York income taxes. New York State Gov. Kathy Hochul and leaders of the state's Assembly and Senate announced a framework to allow those deductions for state purposes for taxable years beginning on or after Jan. 1, according to a spokesperson for the governor. Since cannabis remains a Schedule I illegal substance under federal law, cannabis businesses are not allowed to deduct expenses on federal returns. This 280E exemption on claiming ordinary business tax deductions has impacted legal cannabis companies, including small and medium sized businesses, lawmakers said. The New York State measure will allow those deductions for state purposes. The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF  fell 0.2% on Friday.

2022-04-08 15:14:36,Private equity outperforms public equity: Hamilton Lane,"<p>Private equity investments continued a trend of outperforming public equities, according to a presentation on Thursday by Hamilton Lane Inc. , a specialist in private markets. Between the start of 2017 and January  2022, private markets generated a roughly 2.4x return, compared to a 1.5x return from stocks. Hamilton Lane warned of a potential asset price correction from high North American purchase price multiples, but buyout firms have actually been using less debt and paying more equity for portfolio companies. This means portfolio company balance sheets may be better protected against an economic slowdown. Private market investors may want to slow down their speed of capital deployment amid economic uncertainties tied to a 40-year-high in inflation and geopolitical events.  Overall, the fundraising environment for private equity funds has been red hot in 2021 and 2022, with a spike in venture capital and growth equity investing by LPs. Distressed funds were the only category to show a drop in fundraising activity. The potential high net worth market for private market growth is nearly $80 trillion compared to total pension fund assets of $56 trillion, according to Hamilton Lane. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The greenback also hit another seven-year high against the yen USDJPY, with the Japanese currency depreciating to around 125.36 per dollar; that’s the weakest since it reached an intraday level of 125.65 in June 2015, according to FactSet.Source: FactSetExpectations for higher U.S. rates are rippling throughout the financial system ahead of Tuesday’s consumer-price index report for March, which is expected to show an annual headline rate above 8%. The impact is being felt in everything from rising mortgage rates and car loans to a continued selloff in stocks on Monday. The dollar tends to benefit from higher rate expectations relative to other countries like Japan, where policy makers are more concerned about the risks to the economic recovery and are still clinging to easy monetary policy. “The U.S. dollar continues to be supported by the rising rates,” said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “The U.S. 10-year yield is probing 2.75% and for the first time since 2010 traded above similar Chinese yields.”As of Monday morning, Treasury yields were mostly higher, led by intermediate and long-end rates, while all three major stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP were down.  </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-04-11 13:56:51,Industry survey projects 22% increase in legal U.S. cannabis sales in 2022,"<p>The legal U.S. cannabis market is projected to increase by 22% to $33 billion in retail sales in 2022 from $27 billion in 2021, industry group MJBiz said in a survey released Monday. The study also estimates $99 billion in total positive economic impact from legal cannabis in 2022, up from $81 billion in 2021. By 2025, the retail sales are forecast to rise to $52.7 billion, with a positive economic benefit of just under $158 billion. MJBiz calculated the economic impact by multiplying retail sales by 2.8, after consulting with economists. The estimates include transactions covering the agricultural, manufacturing and retail sectors, as well as events and hospitality in some markets. ""Marijuana businesses, consumers and patients pay hundreds of millions of dollars in state and local taxes that are used to fund government activities at those levels, including schools and roads,"" MJBiz said. ""Real estate also receives a boost from new retail, manufacturing and agricultural businesses moving into an area or established companies expanding, increasing broader demand for commercial properties."" Shares of the AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF  fell 2.4%. The ETF is down 24.6% so far in 2022, compared to a 13.3% loss by the Nasdaq .  </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The company posted net earnings of $159.8 million, or 98 cents a share, for the quarter to Feb. 28, down from $209.9 million, or $1.27 a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales and operating revenue rose to $7.687 billion from $5.164 billion a year ago. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of $1.27 and sales of $7.499 billion. Chief Executive Bill Nash said the quarter was hurt by macro factors but the rollout of a new online instant appraisal offer helped the company retain its position as biggest U.S. buyer of used cars.

2022-04-12 19:16:00,Market Extra: Peak inflation? What’s next for U.S. as markets debate hottest CPI in more than 40 years.,"<p>Stefani Reynolds/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesThe first 8%-plus inflation rate in over four decades is igniting renewed debate in financial markets over whether the U.S. has already reached the height of its feverish spell in price gains.Broadly speaking, Tuesday’s consumer price index report, showing annual headline inflation jumping to 8.5% in March, was enough to give both sides of the argument some ammunition. One camp cites the report’s finer details, like a tame 0.3% monthly core measure that kicks out food and energy, to reach the conclusion that inflation has likely peaked. The other side sees room for price gains to keep going further as the result of non-U.S. factors, like China’s COVID-19 shutdowns and Russia’s war in Ukraine.The financial market’s initial reaction to the CPI report was to focus on the positives, which suggest inflation may start to ease: U.S. stocks DJIASPXCOMP rallied before giving up their gains in the afternoon, while most Treasury yields edged lower as investors factored in prospects that inflation could fall. Investors and traders appeared less concerned about the hot headline number, driven by higher gas and energy prices, and were more focused on the monthly core gauge, which came in at a below-expected 0.3% and was helped by a drop in the cost of used cars. This wouldn’t be the first time the monthly core gauge has fallen off in the past year only to be overshadowed by a soaring annual headline rate down the road: The monthly core measure also fell off from last July to September, hovering at or below 0.3%, just as the then-year-over-year headline rate of 5.3%-5.4% was about to keep jumping for months to come. “We are witnessing history right in front of our eyes today,” Rick Rieder, BlackRock Inc.’s BLK chief investment officer of global fixed income, wrote in a note. “Predicting where we would have been today several months ago would have been next to impossible, particularly given some of the exogenous shock to the system we’ve witnessed.”“We are witnessing inflationary conditions that would have seemed like fantasy (or, more rightly, nightmare) merely a few months ago,” Rieder said. “Indeed, today’s CPI report portrayed some very daunting numbers of much higher prices than a year ago, and the report displayed little prospect of decline in the near-term.”Here is a rundown of the views held by financial-market participants and economists, derived from  their research reports and emails on Tuesday:Inflation Has Probably Peaked“There’s not much to like in today’s CPI figures,” said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. “The best you can say is that core CPI came in lower than expected at ‘only’ 6.5%” on a year-over-year basis. “That might give some relief to markets which were preparing for the worst,” Peron said. “The key now is whether inflation has peaked, and if so, at what pace will it decline. While this reading probably locks in a more aggressive Fed action near-term, there is some reason to believe that CPI will decline enough by year-end to avoid the most severe Fed action. Indeed, that would be our ‘mid-cycle slowdown’ scenario, which remains our base case by a thin margin.”Though inflation likely peaked in March and gasoline/food prices could stabilize in the next few months, “high inflation will be with us at least through the summer because increases in other prices, especially shelter and services, will be sticky,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. “So far, though, Americans continue to spend, and are playing catchup in categories such as restaurants and travel with plenty of savings and low household debt overall.”“Rent inflation appears to be easing a bit, and the buildup of retail inventories is finally dampening goods inflation. Those are positive developments which increase the odds that inflation has in fact peaked,” said Jefferies economists Aneta Markowska and Thomas Simons. However, “while today’s report is encouraging, the Fed is a long way away from claiming victory and will have to remain in inflation-fighting mode.”Inflation Has Room to Run“The drivers of inflation are changing, but price increases are still running historically high,” said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. “Even with durable goods inflation moderating, overall price increases are going to get worse before they get better … The surge in energy prices will ripple across the economy in coming months and push inflation in other categories of goods and services higher. Food prices in particular are at risk of continued rapid increases because of Russia and Ukraine’s roles as global grain and fertilizer suppliers.”“The March report shows some moderation in core CPI, month over month. However, we expect continued price pressure due to the lockdowns in China as the supply chain struggles to normalize,” said Mace McCain, president and chief investment officer at Frost Investment Advisors. “We believe the high headline numbers will keep the Fed on the path of rate increases and the reduction in the balance sheet that has been clearly communicated. We’re hoping the moderation of core inflation will allow the Fed to eventually pause near the neutral rate at end of the year and possibly avoid pushing the United States into a recession.”Inflation “has not yet peaked because expectations are looking more entrenched,” said Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors. He cited one indicator which he says shows “the median 1-year ‘prediction’ of inflation is running at 8 percent.”  </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-04-13 19:00:00,Market Extra: Why traders and investors got a `head-fake’ from one soft U.S. inflation number,"<p>Stefani Reynolds/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Two government reports in the past two days are pointing to the highest annual U.S. inflation rates in four decades, yet many traders and investors are looking past the hot readings and focusing instead on prospects that they might reverse. U.S. stocks and bonds rallied on Wednesday, despite the headline data. The starting point for the market’s optimism about inflation was one soft number in Tuesday’s  consumer-price index report for March: the 0.3% monthly core CPI reading, which kicks out food and energy and came in below expectations. That gauge was no more than “a head-fake” since much of the reading’s weakness came from a 3.8% drop in used-car prices, according to B. of A. economists Ethan Harris and Anna Zhou.The core reading’s moderation overshadowed bigger dynamics that are still at play: Underlying inflation remains “very high,”  Harris and Zhou wrote in a note Wednesday. Indeed, Wednesday’s release of the producer price index showed the cost of wholesale goods and services jumped 1.4% in March and 11.2% over the past year. This comes after Tuesday’s CPI showed the annual headline inflation rising to 8.5%, the highest since 1981.“We think it is a mistake to focus on the traditional measure of core inflation that excludes food and energy,” Harris and Zhou said. “Clearly the traditional core is being buffeted about by temporary price swings related to supply-chain issues and reopening. A popular approach is to trim the core further by plucking out offending items like used car prices. The problem with this approach is that depending on what you pluck out you can come up with almost any number.”On its own, a 0.3% monthly reading in core CPI isn’t all that historically significant. In the decade prior to COVID-19, readings of 0.1% to 0.2% were the norm. Policy makers like to emphasize core readings, though, because they exclude volatile components.The “real” news came later on Tuesday, when the Federal Reserve’s regional bank in Cleveland reported its own median CPI,  which eliminates “unusually high and low components to come up with a better, unbiased measure of underlying inflation,” Harris and Zhou wrote. The Cleveland Fed’s median and trimmed-mean CPI inflation readings are stuck between 6% and 7%. This compares with a 4% annualized growth rate in the core CPI as of March, the economists said.   Source: BLS, Cleveland Fed, BofA Global Research Like Tuesday’s initial market reaction to CPI, Wednesday’s release of U.S. producer prices also saw financial market participants focus on the idea that inflation might eventually ease up.All three major stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP were higher as of Wednesday afternoon, with Dow industrials up by more than 200 points. However, some analysts contend that the relative performance of the energy sector versus healthcare indicates stock-market investors aren’t convinced inflation has peaked.Read: This indicator says stock-market investors don’t believe inflation has peaked: analyst Meanwhile, Treasury yields were broadly lower for a second session on Wednesday as traders continued to factor in the prospects of lower inflation down the road. The 10-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD10Y dropped below 2.7%, while its spread to the 2-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y briefly widened to as much as 38 basis points — a sign of market optimism in the economic outlook. “The PPI print looks somewhat hot, but some investors were looking for an even bigger number than what they got, and are not acknowledging the persistency of inflation as much as they should,”  said head trader John Farawell with Roosevelt & Cross, a bond underwriter in New York.   “They are interpreting this as though we are going to have a soft landing and maybe we are going to not have a recession. This could definitely flip-flop, but this is how they are interpreting it for now,” he said. — Jeffry Bartash contributed to this article.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

""Issues related to cost structure, capital allocation, inventory management and quality control continue to plague the company,"" Blackwells said. The company first started to promote the idea of a sale of Peloton in January after amassing a stake of just less than 5%. Its activism led to the ouster of Founder and CEO John Foley, who moved into the role of executive chairman, while McCarthy, a former CFO of Spotify Technology SA  and Netflix Inc. , became CEO and president and joined the board. Peloton was one of the many companies that benefited strongly during the early days of the pandemic, as people working from home sought convenient ways to exercise with gyms closed.

2022-04-14 16:45:00,"Key Words: Recession is now the ‘most likely’ outcome for the U.S. economy, not a soft landing, Larry Summers says","<p>Mike Theiler/AFP via Getty ImagesFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, whose out-of-consensus views about the risks of persistent inflation have come true, is reiterating his concerns about a potential U.S. downturn: He now says a recession is “the most likely thing” partly because the Federal Reserve “is going to have to keep going [in its effort to subdue inflation] until we see disinflation.”In an interview with Bloomberg Economics released on Thursday, Summers, a paid contributor to Bloomberg, said that “the odds on a hard landing within the next two years are certainly better than half, and quite possibly two-thirds or more.” One of the mechanisms that will bring about a recession is the central bank’s response to elevated inflation, Summers said, adding that “we’re not going to see disinflation back toward the target range until we see unemployment rise, meaningfully.”See:Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says not impossible for the Fed to engineer a soft landing for the U.S. economyThe publication of Summers’s comments come just two days after the consumer price index data showed the annual headline U.S. inflation rate jumping to 8.5% in March, the highest level since 1981. The rate has remained well above the Fed’s 2% target for almost a year, putting central bankers under pressure to aggressively raise target lending rates. Expectations for higher rates are rippling out throughout the economy, with the average 30-year mortgage rate soaring to 5% for the first time in a decade. Meanwhile, financial-market participants continue to debate whether inflation has hit a peak.“If you look at history, there has never been a moment when inflation was above 4% and unemployment was below 5% when we did not have a recession within the next two years,” Summers said, according to a Bloomberg transcript. “I don’t think the idea that is still embodied in Fed forecasts — that we could have continuing supertight labor markets at 3½% unemployment, and we could have inflation come down rapidly — is a terribly plausible one.”Generally, economists appear to be coming around to the potential for a downturn: A Wall Street Journal survey of economists in April puts the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 28%, up from 13% a year ago. On Thursday, investors aggressively sold off Treasurys as they assessed the path forward on inflation, with yields rising across the board.

2022-04-20 19:21:05,Rite Aid's stock rockets after the New York Post reported it rejected a buyout bid at a hefty premium,"<p>Shares of Rite Aid Corp.  rocketed as much as 38.5% intraday before paring gains to be up 18.7% in very active afternoon trading Wednesday, after the New York Post reported that the drugstore chain rejected earlier this month a buyout bid that valued the company at more than $800 million. Trading volume swelled to about 16 million share, compared with the full-day average of about 4.3 million shares. On March 30, private-equity firm Spear Point Capital Management said it would pay $14.60 for each Rite Aid shares outstanding, the New York Post reported, citing Spear Point co-Founder Ron Bienvenu. That represents a 56.0% premium to the March 30 closing price of $9.36, and a 97.3% premium to Tuesday's closing price of $7.40. After Rite Aid followed by rejecting the bid, Spear Point's Bienvenu told the NYP that the firm is considering a hostile tender offer directly to shareholders. The company's market capitalization is currently about $489.8 million. Rite Aid's stock had closed at a 2 1/2-year low of $6.99 on April 7, which was a week before the company reported a wider-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter loss. The stock has tumbled 40.2% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500  has slipped 6.3%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-04-20 17:57:05,Tesla stock-option 'straddle' priced for post-earnings move of more than $66,"<p>A stock-options strategy known as a ""straddle"" on Tesla Inc.'s stock  is priced Wednesday for a one-day, post-earnings move of $66.56, according to data provided by Option Research & Technology Services (ORATS) Principal Matt Amberson. That's slightly less than average price move over the past 12 quarters of $67.27, ORATS data show. A straddle is a pure volatility play in which bullish (calls) and bearish (puts) with at-the-money strikes, with expirations at the end of the week, are purchased simultaneously. The pricing indicates that straddle buyers will profit from the purchase if the stock moves more than $66.56 in either direction on Thursday, which at current prices would imply a percentage move of about 6.8%. Tesla is scheduled to report first-quarter results after Wednesday's closing bell.

More than two-thirds (68%) said the effort would have no effect on their visitation habits, 15% said they would visit less often and 13% said they would visit more often. BTIG notes that Starbucks is required by law to negotiate with unions, but a contract isn't guaranteed. Nearly 200 of Starbucks' 9,000 U.S. locations have petitioned for union elections with eight locations receiving certification from the National Labor Relations Board. Workers in Buffalo voted to unionize in December 2021 and have a year to execute a contract or could possibly have to dissolve the union, according to BTIG. ""Given the industry-leading average hourly earnings of $17 per hour (this summer) for Starbucks employees, in addition to healthcare benefits, tuition reimbursement, paid-time-off, we are unsure what concrete resolution the unionization effort seeks to achieve,"" analysts said. ""Our understanding is that employees are frustrated by issues that are plaguing the entire industry right now including staffing shortages, scheduling, poor training, and high turnover, issues that could be tempered with menu simplification, but not resolved with a contract."" Howard Schultz, Starbucks' interim/returning chief executive said recently that new employee benefits may not include unionized workers, reports The Wall Street Journal. Schultz has also suspended share buybacks in order to invest in workers and stores. BTIG rates Starbucks stock buy with a $110 price target, down from $130. ""We believe that prior momentum is returning as coronavirus disruption fades and customer mobility returns, setting up a strong sales and earnings recovery outlook over the coming quarters,"" analysts led by Peter Saleh wrote.

""[A] large number of Wall Street firms and their bankers and lawyers appear to be capitalizing on ESG to drive profits without doing nearly enough to support tangible societal progress,"" Icahn wrote in a letter to fellow McDonald's shareholders. ""These players seem to be engaged in a cover-up to downplay their ESG-related economic incentives and promote their purported social impact. Clearly, the ESG status quo on Wall Street needs to change."" Icahn launched a proxy fight against McDonald's earlier this year, nominating two board members and saying that he understood the 2012 pledge to improve pig welfare meant the end of gestation crates all together, not changes in their use. Icahn calls out the cruelty of this farming practice and the significance of issues like animal welfare. ""A company's reluctance to improve policies and verification methods represents a serious risk to a business, its bottom line and the world around us,"" the letter says. ""Even McDonald's, which is not prioritizing animal welfare enough, includes it as a risk factor in the Company's 10-K."" Icahn calls the failure to act evidence of board member non-performance and suggests the company should spend the $16 million it's investing to fight him on helping pigs. ""It might seem like a small contribution toward the investment that will be required to achieve the kind of change that is needed in McDonald's' supply chain, but it would have been better -- far better -- than spending that money in defense of the directors at McDonald's who have failed in this area,"" he said.

""Since several lawmakers are retiring or will be defeated and therefore become 'lame ducks' who never again have to justify their votes to the electorate, there will be many more lawmakers than normal who can vote their consciences without political consequences that would open up the U.S. financial system to domestic cannabis companies to win approval in Congress.""

""Our freight rail service hearing highlighted the grave concerns of shippers and others regarding freight rail service,"" STB Chairman Martin J. Oberman said in a statement. ""While the railroads have faced certain challenges over the last few years, the evidence produced at last week's hearing is overwhelming that the railroads' longstanding practice of reducing operating ratios by cutting employment levels, mothballing locomotives, and eliminating other essential resources are the central reasons why farmers have been hours away from depopulating herds, manufacturing facilities have reduced operating hours, and shippers cannot get their products to market on time or receive essential raw materials for their companies."" The ""failures"" are harming the economy and contributing to inflation, Oberman said.
