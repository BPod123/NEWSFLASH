There's the ""potential liquidation of 56.3M HOOD shares (7.4% of outstanding) owned by Sam Bankman-Fried through Emergent Fidelity Technologies,"" though the timing of that is ""uncertain"" in Allen's view. Additionally, FTX's implosion has removed it from the list of possible Robinhood acquirers.

It should further have known its own internal risk management procedures were inadequate to prevent it and that staff were not following anti-money laundering processes and complying with laws. That allowed them to transact billions of dollars in suspicious transactions in the U.S. and other countries in the period stretching from 2009 to 2016 that accounted for 99% of the branch's profit.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose about 105 points, or 0.3%, ending near 34,110, according to FactSet, after initially climbing about 700 points in early trade. The S&amp;P 500 index  gained 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite Index  advanced 1%. The latest consumer-price index for November showed annual inflation slowed to 7.1% from 7.7% a month before, adding to the retreat in the cost of living from a pandemic peak of 9.1% in June. Lower inflation, though still painfully high, gave more hope to investors that the Federal Reserve might be able to increase rates at a less dramatic pace than earlier in 2022, while potentially pausing at a ""terminal,"" or peak, rate that produces a soft-ish landing for the U.S. economy. Bond yields fell Tuesday after the inflation reading, with the 10-year Treasury rate tumbling 11.1 basis points to 3.5%, the biggest daily yield decline for the benchmark rate since Dec. 1, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Discovery  on Wednesday said it expected to take bigger charges related to its acquisition of AT&amp;T's  WarnerMedia, as it tries to pare down operations. The recently combined company - the parent of HBO, CNN and other channels - said in a filing that it expects pretax restructuring charges of $4.1 billion to $5.3 billion, including $2.8 billion to $3.5 billion of content-impairment and development write-offs. Those figures are up from prior estimates of $3.2 billion to $4.3 billion in restructuring charges, with content-impairment and development write-offs of roughly $2 billion to $2.5 billion. The exact reason for the increase was unclear, but it comes after the company's efforts to lower costs, including through layoffs and pulling back on programming, in the wake of the acquisition. Warner Bros. Discovery said it was not revising prior estimates on costs related to organizational restructuring - such as for severance from layoffs and relocation - or costs related to cash expenditures, consolidating facilities or terminating contracts. However, it said that the ongoing reorganization, still expected to largely wrap up by the end of 2024, ""could result in additional impairments above the revised estimates.""

2022-12-14 17:34:00,: Oil futures trade near the session’s highs,"<p>Oil futures traded near the session’s best levels early Wednesday afternoon, supported by the International Energy Agency’s forecasts for stronger demand growth this year and next. Data from the Energy Information Administration early Wednesday showed a hefty 10.2 million-barrel rise in U.S. crude supplies for the week ended Dec. 9. However, Matt Smith, lead oil analyst, Americas, at Kpler, pointed out in its report, the EIA also made a positive adjustment of nearly 2.3 million barrels per day to petroleum supply — “essentially adding back in nearly 16 million barrels of unaccounted-for supply.” He attributed the unaccounted-for supply to “considerably” lower exports on the U.S. Gulf Coast last week “than the EIA is reporting.” The “adjustment” to the figures is essentially a “balancing item,” explained Smith. When the EIA can’t balance supply and demand, it has to make an adjustment in order to balance the books, though he admits that this week’s number is huge, and just shy of the record.

2022-12-15 21:25:00,Market Extra: ‘The Fed is going to overdo it’: Financial markets finally react to U.S. central bank’s 2023 rate outlook and weak data,"<p>Alex Wong/Getty ImagesFinancial markets finally absorbed the Federal Reserve’s stridently hawkish interest-rate outlook for 2023, weighing the prospects of a 5%-plus level in borrowing costs in the new year against fresh signs of a weakening U.S. economy on Thursday.  A bigger-than-expected drop in November’s retail sales plus weak regional manufacturing data added to the growing impression that the world’s largest economy is about to tip into a recession next year. Dow industrials DJIA had its worst day in three months on such fears Thursday, while investors fled to the safety of long-term government debt and sent the dollar — a traditional haven during times of turmoil — to a two-day high.Wednesday’s initial skepticism in some corners of the financial market to the Fed’s higher-than-expected 2023 median rate projection of 5.1% and need to keep rates up for longer was replaced by investors’ gradual realization that the central bank might actually do what it says  — just as the world’s largest economy appears to be teetering.  The Fed’s main policy rate target currently sits between 4.25% and 4.5%, up from almost zero at the start of this year.“To some extent, markets are still digesting the takeaways from the Fed’s dot plot, the press conference, and the statement,” said Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Philadelphia-based Glenmede, which manages $38.5 billion in assets. “There are a lot of different things at play. On one hand, the Fed is going to raise rates more. But on the other hand, that’s also increasing the probability of a recession. Investors may be buying into that fact,” resulting in Thursday’s flight to safety.While the bond market was reacting to “many cross currents” of risk, stock markets were behaving in a “more one-directional” manner and fell sharply as the result of November’s disappointing retail-sales data plus the prospect of more Fed rate hikes in 2023, Reynolds said via phone. “We’ve been waiting for monetary policy to hit the consumer, and now it has — putting a dent in the odds of a soft landing.”In the hours that followed the Fed’s hawkish emphasis on restoring price stability on Wednesday, financial markets reacted in a surprisingly muted way: Dow industrials and the S&amp;P 500 SPX, for instance, partially reversed their late-day losses by the end of the New York trading session. And 2-, 10- and 30-year Treasury yields finished the day just slightly higher — suggesting that even bond investors doubted the Fed’s inflation-fighting resolve.Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid, Henry Allen and others summed up the FOMC meeting and reaction like this: “You would probably say that [Fed officials] were hawkish, but that the market doesn’t believe they will be,”  they wrote in a Thursday morning note.As Thursday’s trading session wore on, though, sentiment appeared to shift as central banks outside the U.S. also hiked rates. Just as the Fed did on Wednesday, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank raised borrowing costs by a half-percentage-point each. ECB President Christine Lagarde was especially emphatic about the need to stay the course, saying policy makers could keep hiking rates at their next one to two meetings or possibly more and that policy makers are “in for the long game.”  Read: ECB slows rate hikes, but signals it’s far from doneAll three major U.S. stock indexes finished Thursday’s session lower, with Dow industrials logging its worst day since Sept. 13. A swell of buying in Treasurys pushed the 10- BX:TMUBMUSD10Y  and 30-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD30Y to one-week lows. Gold added to Fed-day losses, while oil futures ended lower, as the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY jumped 0.8%.Pimco global economic advisor Richard Clarida is among those who said on Thursday that avoiding at least a modest recession in the U.S. will be a challenge.  Meanwhile, Capital  Economics’ Andrew Hunter said he sees a mild downturn in the first half of 2023 “as the Fed’s relentless hawkishness takes its toll.”“Markets are now realizing, and it’s now sinking in, that the bar for rate cuts next year is going to be really high,” Daniel Tenengauzer, BNY Mellon’s head of markets strategy, said via phone. If anything, falling bond yields, which some had initially read as expressing doubt about the Fed’s resolve, are “telling you the Fed is going to overdo it.”   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
