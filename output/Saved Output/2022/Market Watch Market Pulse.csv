2022-09-12 12:37:28,Cable One stock downgraded as Wells Fargo sees various pressures on cable industry,"<p>Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall downgraded shares of Cable One Inc.  to equal-weight from overweight Monday, warning of the spending trajectory ahead for the broader cable universe. ""While we think CABO has the strongest/best network-nearly 70% fiber by mileage-it's also well known that incremental competition is coming to all areas, including rural,"" Cahall wrote. He expects that the upcoming capital-expenditure cycle in the cable industry will pressure free-cash flow for Cable One and fellow providers. He predicts Cable One will have to spend $200 for each home passed, compared with $300 for both Comcast Corp.  and Charter Communications Inc. , and perhaps $600 for Altice USA Inc. . ""While our capex may be too heavy in the near term, we think we're directionally right for the sector that a build phase is ahead,"" Cahell wrote. ""While CABO's capex cycle may be somewhat less severe vs peers, it's still a necessity, as competition in rural markets is increasing from FWA, fiber, and eventually, satellite."" Additionally, though Cahall sees Cable One as ""still the best house"" in the challenged cable neighborhood, he doubts the company will be ""immune"" to pressures in the industry. ""We think CABO's markets skew to lower-income cohorts, hence inflation and higher gas prices have a bigger impact on sub metrics,"" he wrote, while cutting his price target on the stock to $1,200 from $1,700.

2022-09-12 20:40:00,"The Tell: Traders see inflation falling for rest of 2022, but that likely won’t end Fed rate hikes or market volatility","<p>Brandon Bell/Getty ImagesThere’s a bit of good and bad news in the run-up to the next major U.S. inflation data on Tuesday,  following July’s bigger-than-expected decline in the U.S. consumer-price index which triggered a short-term relief rally among stock investors.The corner of financial markets with money on the line in getting the CPI data just right is expecting a continued drop in inflation for August and the rest of the year. Traders of derivatives-like instruments known as fixings now expect August’s annual headline inflation rate to be 8.1%, down from 8.5% in July. They also see the rate gradually declining to 7.7% for September, 6.9% for October, almost 6.4% for November, and 6.1% for December. The problem is that the decline still likely won’t be nearly enough to put an end to continued rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, or the market volatility that accompanies them.Read:Inflation is slowing, U.S. August CPI to show, but not enough to mollify a worried FedThe reason is that the number that matters almost as much as the annual headline CPI rate is the so-called core reading, which kicks out volatile food and energy prices, said Gang Hu, an inflation trader with New York hedge fund WinShore Capital Partners. By his calculations, headline inflation readings at these levels through year-end imply monthly core readings of 0.3%, or 3.6% on a 12-month basis. “There’s been quite a bit of change after the last CPI report, and the market definitely sees readings that are a fair amount lower than where they were before,” Hu said via phone on Monday. “You could have a relief rally in bonds and equities if these numbers are realized, but I don’t think the relief rally is going to stay.”“The Fed is going to hike 75 basis points next week, to above 3%. But core inflation is stabilizing around the wrong levels, and if you have inflation at 0.3% for the next three to four months, the job is not done and the Fed will have to keep going,” Hu said via phone. “We don’t know how much further the Fed will have to keep going or when is going to be enough.”  Hu isn’t alone in his views. Robert Conzo, chief executive and managing director of The Wealth Alliance in Melville, New York, which oversees $1.5 billion, said that while he thinks CPI is on a downward trend, the degree to which that happens and just how sticky inflation may remain is still unknown. Once those trends become more apparent, that will give the Fed a firm direction, he said in an email. And once the central bank’s rate-hike cycle ends is when investors will see the next big recovery in stocks, according to Conzo.As of Monday, stock investors appeared to be somewhat optimistic. All three major stock indexes DJIASPX COMP finished with their fourth straight session of gains, adding to last week’s gains. Treasury yields were mixed, though the policy-sensitive 2-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD02Y was still at its highest level since November 2007. Fed funds futures traders were pricing in a 67% chance that the Fed’s main policy rate target will get to between 3.75% and 4% by December, up from a current level of between 2.25% and 2.5%. And fixings traders are expecting an annual headline CPI inflation rate that eventually subsides to around 2.7% next July, but the truth is “the market doesn’t have much idea of what’s going to happen five months from now,” Hu said.“The Fed’s concern is less about spot inflation. The big concern is about inflation expectations,” said the WinShore Capital Partners trader. “The Fed has to firmly control inflation expectations so spot inflation doesn’t completely change the view of inflation in society. Retail gas is coming down very quickly, but, on the other side, food and rent prices continue to go up. So the Fed has no choice but to show markets it’s in control of inflation.”</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-09-16 20:02:00,The Tell: Wall Street’s most pessimistic bank sees almost 5% fed-funds rate on horizon,"<p>Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesAs financial market gloom continued to deepen on Friday, Deutsche Bank, Wall Street’s most pessimistic bank, came out with yet another eye-opening view: Its U.S. economists, led by Matt Luzzetti, now expect the Federal Reserve to end its rate-hike campaign at 4.9% in 2023’s first quarter.The notion of an almost 5% fed-funds rate, which in Deutsche Bank’s own words is “way beyond” what the market is pricing, comes just days ahead of the Fed’s next meeting on Sept. 20-21 and as investors remain anxious about how high interest rates will have to go to tame the worst stretch of inflation in four decades. Investors were still trying to wrap their heads around the likelihood that the fed-funds rate target will likely rise above 4% by year-end, and the stock market sold off on Friday — fueled by a profit warning by FedEx Corp. FDX, along with inflation and rate fears.Few market participants have openly talked about the prospect of an almost 5% fed-funds rate target, essentially double the current level of 2.25% to 2.5%. Such a scenario could have an even more punishing effect on stocks than what’s been predicted by billionaire investor and hedge-fund manager Ray Dalio, who estimates that a 4.5% level on rates would produce a 20% negative impact on equity prices. Meanwhile, one key market rate — the one-year Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD01Y — hovered near 4% on Friday, a development that some say could spill over into other rates and exacerbate worries throughout financial markets, in the U.S. and abroad. Deutsche Bank’s revised interest-rate forecast “is all about the inflation profile and how we expect inflation to remain at higher levels for longer,” Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist, said via phone. “The Fed has always gotten the fed-funds rate target above inflation during all of its past tightening cycles, whether inflation was high or not.”“For policy to be restrictive, real or inflation-adjusted rates need to be positive and, right now, Fed officials can’t rely on forecasts about inflation to decline over time,” he told MarketWatch. “For them to have confidence, they need to get the fed-funds rate above inflation, at least by early next year,” he said, although Deutsche Bank doesn’t expect an almost 5% fed-funds rate to be sustained for very long.  Deutsche Bank’s U.S. economists revised their expectations after Tuesday’s unexpectedly hot consumer-price index report for August, and the upgrade is now closer to the 5% to 6% range that some at the bank think is needed to cool inflation.Friday brought another downbeat day in financial markets, with all three major stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP finishing lower after trimming earlier heavy losses. FedEx’s profit warning was being read by some, such as BNP Paribas Chief U.S. Economist Carl Riccadonna, as fitting into his view that a “massive deceleration” is under way for the U.S. economy.Deutsche Bank was the first major Wall Street bank to call a U.S. recession in April. That same month, it went out further on a limb to say that it saw downside risk to its own pessimistic view. In June, Tim Wessel, a macro strategist, said he saw a chance that inflation fails to decelerate. And just three days ago, Henry Allen, a research analyst, said “that the pessimists will sadly prevail on this occasion” when it comes to the debate over whether the U.S. economy can achieve a soft landing.  On Friday, Deutsche Bank was joined by Dutch financial-services company Rabobank, with another take on the prospect of higher-than-expected rates. Strategist Philip Marey said Rabobank now expects the fed-funds rate to peak at 5% next year, up from its prior forecast of 4.5%, given persistent inflation and a wage-price spiral that’s already under way. Rabobank also doesn’t expect the Fed to pivot from its rate stance before 2024.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-09-16 11:00:57,"UPS stock falls after FedEx profit warning, but Citi sees better execution and market share gains","<p>Shares of United Parcel Service Inc.  dropped 6.7% in premarket trading toward a three month low, weighed down by rival package deliver FedEx Corp.'s  profit and revenue warning, but Citi analyst Christian Wetherbee said UPS appears to be managing the tough macro environment better than its rival. FedEx's stock plunged 19.6% toward a two-year low, after saying late Thursday that it suffered lower global volumes, a trend that worsened toward the end of the quarter and is expected to weaken further in the current quarter. Citi's Wetherbee said it's hard to assume UPS isn't affected by the macro/service headwinds that FedEx noted, but his conversations with UPS management suggest ""a level of confidence"" that they did better in matching costs and revenue. He wrote in a research note that FedEx's warning was clearly a negative for UPS, ""but we think UPS continues to execute more effectively and with some [market] share gains, it should be a relative outperformer."" UPS stock, which had already dropped 7.6% amid a three-day losing streak through Thursday, has dropped 13.7% year to date, while FedEx shares have tumbled 20.8%, the Dow Jones Transportation Average  has dropped 18.0% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has shed 14.8%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-09-16 10:56:54,EU regulator recommends extending Gilead's COVID treatment Veklury for use in pediatric patients,"<p>Gilead Sciences Inc.  said Friday the European regulator has adopted a positive opinion on extending the use of its COVID treatment Veklury for pediatric patients.

2022-09-16 10:20:19,Coronavirus tally: WHO expands guidelines for Gilead's COVID treatment Veklury,"<p>The World Health Organization expanded its recommended guide for the use of Gilead's  COVID-19 treatment Veklury late Thursday, adding another treatment to its toolbox. The company said WHO updated its guidelines to recommend the drug to treat patients with severe COVID, an expansion from simply ""those with non-severe COVID-19 at the highest risk of hospitalization."" In late July, European Commission regulators recommended that Veklury be used as an expanded COVID-19 treatment. The move comes as U.S. known cases of COVID are continuing to ease, although the true tally is likely higher given how many people are testing at home, where the data are not being collected. The daily average for new cases stood at 64,308 on Thursday, according to a New York Times tracker, down 28% from two weeks ago. The daily average for hospitalizations was down 11% at 33,143while the daily average for deaths is down 4% to 491.  Globally, the confirmed case tally rose above 611 million on Friday, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins, while the death toll is above 6.52 million with the U.S. leading the world with 95.6 million cases and 1,052,939 deaths.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
