Separately, the company said long-time Chief Executive Joe Flanagan will step down from the role after almost 10 years with the company. The stock was headed for its biggest one-day drop since going public in May 2010. Earlier Tuesday, the company said it swung to a third-quarter net loss of $29.5 million, or 7 cents a share, from net income of $17.0 million, or 5 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding nonrecurring items, such as a $9.5 million increase in allowance for credit losses, FactSet said adjusted earnings per share of 8 cents missed the consensus estimate of 14 cents. The company disclosed that the increased allowance for credit losses was for a physician customer facing ""financial challenges"" that was unable to make a ""contractually required payment"" on Sept. 30. The last time the company missed EPS expectations was for the fourth quarter of 2019. Revenue for the latest quarter grew 30.6% to $496.0 million, but was below the FactSet consensus of $523.7 million.

The company said recent regulatory developments relating to its ovarian cancer drug Rubraca and challenges in raising fresh capital, ""a potential bankruptcy filing in the very near term looks increasingly probable as a way to preserve the value of our business and assets for the benefit of our stakeholders."" For now, the company is still evaluating its strategic options and discussing in and out of bankruptcy financing options with creditors, Clovis said in a regulatory filing. Rubraca is the company's sole product, but it faces steep competition from AstraZeneca   and Merck's  Lynparza and GSK's   Zejula, which are approved in the first-line maintenance ovarian cancer setting and have become the standard of care. Rubraca is approved as a second-line maintenance treatment for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who respond to chemo. That is a smaller and shrinking patient pool, given the competition from Lynparza and Zejula. The Food and Drug Administration has told Clovis it requires more mature patient survival data from its late-stage trial dubbed Athena-Mono and said it would closely scrutinize its application for approval. Clovis had a net loss of $56 million in the third quarter, narrower than the $67.4 million loss posted in the year-earlier period.

""In what has been a dark comedy show with Twitter, Musk has essentially tarnished the Tesla story/stock and is starting to potentially impact the Tesla brand with this ongoing Twitter train wreck disaster,"" Ives wrote in a note to clients. ""From selling Tesla stock again and again, to the PR nightmare that Twitter has become, cutting 50% of employees and then needing to bring some back, Musk's attention focus from Tesla to Twitter, and ultimately the fear that this Twitter lightening rod of controversy on a daily (almost hourly) basis starts to negatively change the Tesla brand globally."" Tesla IS Musk, Ives wrote, and it has made him the richest man in the world. Tesla is the golden child of his empire, and he's changed the auto world much in the way that Apple's  iPhone changed phones. But now he has managed to do what short sellers tried and failed -- to crush Tesla's stock despite the EV company being in a position of strength. Ives said he still believes in the EV story as a longer-term play, but Tesla's roughly 25% selloff since the Twitter deal is ""an agonizing cycle for investors to navigate and has put massive pressure on the stock as its a Boy Who Cried Wolf narrative shaping up."" Ives is sticking with his outperform rating on Tesla stock but lowered his price target to $250 from $300 to reflect the overhang.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  shot up about 1,198 points, or 3.7%, ending near 33,712, marking its highest level since August and its best daily percentage gain since May 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&amp;P 500 index  gained 5.5% and the Nasdaq Composite Index  closed up 7.4%, their best daily percentage increases since 2020. The sharp rally on Wall Street was led by gains in technology and communication shares, segments of the S&amp;P 500 that booked massive gains of about 8.3% and 6.3%, respectively, according to FactSet. Buyers came out in force after the release of October's consumer-price index showed a 7.7% annual rate of inflation, down from 9.1% this summer, while spurring hopes that the Federal Reserve might be making headway in its fight to bring inflation down to its 2% target.
