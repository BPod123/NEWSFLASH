The holding company has an exchangeable share structure that is designed to trigger full ownership of U.S. cannabis investments and take advantage of U.S. cannabis market opportunities. Canopy USA will house Acreage Holdings Inc. , Wana and Jetty and allow Canopy to exercise rights to own 100% of the companies. Third-party investors will hold 100% of the common shares of Canopy USA, the company said. Canopy Chief Executive David Klein said the company expects the U.S. market to be worth more than $50 billion by 2026. Constellation Brands Inc. , which invested $4 billion in Canopy when Canada fully legalized cannabis for adult use in 2018, said it will convert its common stock holdings into new exchangeable shares, which will allow it to protect its own shareholder value, while retaining an interest in Canopy in non-voting and non-participating shares. That will allow the drinks giant to focus on its core beer, wine and spirits business. Constellation CEO Bill Newlands said the deal will allow the liquor company to ""further reinforce our intent to not deploy additional investment in Canopy aligned with [the company's] previously stated capital allocation priorities."" Shares of Constellation Brands are down 8.5% in 2022, compared to a loss of 20.3% by the S&amp;P 500 [s spx], while Acreage shares have lost 61% of their value this year, compared to a 59% drop by the AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF .</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Meanwhile, the chance of a 75-basis-point move was seen at 84.1%, down from 88.5% a day ago. The shifting odds are unusual because an aggressive 75-basis-point November hike has generally been regarded as a done deal, and investors have been more focused on the size of December's rate move.

2022-11-01 19:05:00,"Market Extra: Optimism seeps into Treasurys, fueled by hopes for intervention and ‘some positive news’ out of Powell","<p>Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesInvestors have been turning upbeat about government bonds in recent days, helping the benchmark 10-year Treasury note break a 12-week losing streak at the end of last week. A rally in long-dated government debt resumed on Tuesday, following a brief one-day selloff in the prior session — sending yields on the 10- BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, 20- and 30-year maturities BX:TMUBMUSD30Y lower in New York trading. Lower yields reflect higher demand for the underlying Treasurys since prices and yields move in opposite directions. Until roughly a week ago, expectations for an unrelenting Federal Reserve to stick with aggressive rate hikes in hopes of driving down the hottest inflation in four decades fueled a rapid selloff in Treasurys, pushing 10- and 30-year yields to their highest levels in at least a decade by the end of U.S. trading on Oct. 24. Since then, however, the narrative has shifted toward two possibilities: One is hope that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell might say something which suggests the central bank will ease off aggressive rate hikes soon, after the central bank delivers one more 75-basis-point rate hike on Wednesday. The other is the prospect of government intervention to address poor liquidity in the $24 trillion Treasurys market. The two lines of thinking, along with the ability to finally earn a decent yield, are adding up to renewed interest in long-dated government debt.After the 10-year yield peaked at 4.3% on an intraday basis Oct. 20, “yield levels got to fairly attractive levels and some buying came back into the marketplace, with some people squaring up positions,” said Greg Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities in New York. That contributed to the 10-year rate’s drop to as low as 3.9% on Oct. 26, or within a matter of a week. As investors braced for Wednesday’s widely expected rate hike by the Federal Open Market Committee, Treasurys put in “a solid performance overnight,” leaving yields in the process of a “pre-FOMC consolidation,” according to BMO Capital Markets strategists Ian Lyngen and Ben Jeffery. In a note, they said there’s a “collective sense that a policy pivot is the next macro event.”Nonetheless, economic data released on Tuesday, which showed that U.S. job openings rose to 10.7 million in September, dented the stock market’s hopes for a slower pace of Fed rate hikes and was enough to send the policy-sensitive 2-year Treasury yield above 4.5% as investors sold off short- to intermediate-dated government debt. Meanwhile, demand for long-dated debt remained in place, leaving the 10-, 20- and 30-year yields all lower on Tuesday: The 10-year yield was down at 4.05%, the 20-year was 4.37%, and the 30-year rate was 4.12% as U.S. stocks SPXDJIA gave up early gains to finish lower.Stock Market Today: Live coverage of Monday’s market actionVia phone on Tuesday, Faranello said “the market is looking for Powell to convincingly say the Fed is going to downshift, but I’m not sure the market is going to get what it’s looking for. We are going to get a lot more inflation data, so while there may be a debate between a 75-basis-point hike and a 50-basis-point one going forward, I’d be surprised if he laid all his cards on the table.”“This market is really hungry, after a very long year, for some positive news coming out of the Fed,” he said. It’s prepared for a “dovish hike,” or rate increase delivered with a relatively easier policy outlook, and “markets are susceptible here to being disappointed, which could affect asset classes across the board.”Meanwhile, reports suggesting that the Treasury Department might be willing to intervene in the government-bond market is another variable behind why some investors are stepping back into bonds, according to Faranello.  On Sunday, the Financial Times reported that bond investors are urging the Treasury Department to step in after months of volatility. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-11-01 19:02:29,Stocks post back-to-back losses Tuesday ahead of Fed decision on interest rates,"<p>U.S. stocks finished lower Tuesday for a second straight session, with risk appetite waning a day before the conclusion of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting that is expected to produce another jumbo increase to the central bank's policy rate. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  shed about 82 points, or 0.3%, ending near 32,650. The S&amp;P 500 index  closed down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite Index  declined by 0.9%, according to FactSet. Earlier gains for major equity benchmarks were erased Tuesday after an economic report showed the number of jobs openings for September rose to 10.7 million, which was below the 11.9 million record in March but likely still too high for Fed officials hoping that previous rate hikes would have helped to cool inflation and bring job openings back down to a historical norm. Higher rates this year have dramatically cooled the U.S. housing market, putting record prices in some regions in retreat. Borrowing costs also have shot higher for households and companies. Ford Motor Credit, the financing arm of Ford Motor Co.,  was looking to borrow at least $1 billion on Tuesday in the bond market, despite corporate bond yields that have hit their highest level since 2009.  </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The probe looked at allegations of ""channel stuffing"", a deceptive practice used to inflate sales and earnings by deliberately sending more product to distributors than they can reasonably sell. The practice was alleged to have been used by former members of senior management to achieve exec comp targets in 2021. ""The Audit and Finance Committee concluded that there was no evidence of intentional wrongdoing or fraud,"" the company said in a regulatory filing. However, the company's former CEO and former CFO ""violated provisions"" of the company's code of ethics and business conduct. ""In addition, these former members of senior management did not maintain and promote an appropriate control environment focused on compliance in areas of the company's business, nor did they sufficiently promote, monitor or enforce adherence to the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct,"" said the filing. The same two execs ""created a culture where employees did not feel comfortable raising concerns without fear of retaliation. The former CFO, Jorge Gomez, was ousted from Moderna Inc.  after just two days in the job once news of the probe broke earlier this year. Gomez  was CFO at Dentsply from 2019 to 2022. Dentsply said it now expects to book a pretax noncash charge for goodwill impairment in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion for the nine months through September, as macroeconomic factors such as higher cost of capital, cost inflation, the strong dollar, and increased supply chain costs, lead it to reduce guidance for revenue, operating margins and future cash flows.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 322 points, or 1%, trading near 32,977. The S&amp;P 500 index  was up 0.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  was 0.5% higher, after all three indexes earlier in the session were lower, heading for a third day in a row of losses, according to FactSet. While investors were widely anticipating the fourth straight jumbo rate increase from the Fed, they also have been warming to the idea that Chairman Jerome Powell might be willing to deliver a smaller rate increase in December, particularly with stocks and bonds awash in losses this year and with the U.S. housing market's dramatic pullback in the face of 7% fixed rate 30-year mortgages.

Concerns that the Fed is “much more likely to overshoot on rates rather than doing too little” have grown, raising the risk of the economy “tipping” into recession, said Robbie Fraser, manager, global research and analytics at Schneider Electric. That’s a particularly “bearish prospect for crude prices due to the potential demand hit, and is further reinforced by the stronger dollar that weighs on dollar-denominated crude prices.” U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery CLZ22 fell $1.83, or 2%, to settle at $88.17 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices on Wednesday had settled at $90, the highest front-month contract finish since Oct. 10, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
