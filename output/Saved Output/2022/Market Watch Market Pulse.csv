Previously, the FDA had only authorized a booster for people aged 16 years and older. ""The booster vaccination increases the level of immunity and improves protection against COVID-19 across all age groups that have been authorized to receive one,"" said BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin. ""In the current situation, it is important to offer all eligible individuals a booster, particularly against the backdrop of the newly-emerging variants such as Omicron."" The FDA also reduced the time between getting the two-dose vaccine regimen and the booster shot to five months from six months. The FDA's EUA comes after ""real world evidence"" of more than 4.1 million booster doses administered given at least 5 months after the primary series of doses showed no new safety concerns in children 12 through 17 years of age. The news didn't help the companies' stocks, however, as shares of Pfizer dropped 3.7% in morning trading and BioNTech slumped 6.6%. Meanwhile, share of Moderna Inc.  sank 8.1% and Johnson & Johnson  slipped 0.4%, while the S&amp;P 500  rose 0.1%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

""We expect to report a very strong start to fiscal 2022 across-the-board, with first quarter revenue well above our guidance,"" Chief Executive Steve MacMillan said in a statement.

2022-01-10 16:04:00,"The Tell: Almost every Federal Reserve meeting in 2022 could be potentially `at play’ for a potential rate hike, Deutsche Bank says","<p>Jim Watson/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesFederal Reserve policy makers have been “way behind the curve” since early last year in tightening policy, and there’s now the possibility that they might need to consider hiking interest rates at almost every meeting in 2022, according to Deutsche Bank researchers.Deutsche Bank’s economists expect four hikes in 2022, starting in March, which is roughly in line with the market’s expectations, they wrote in a Monday note. They also foresee the reduction of the Fed’s more than $8 trillion balance sheet beginning in the third quarter, or after two rate hikes are delivered. Nonetheless, “unless financial conditions notably tighten then all seven meetings from March to the end of 2022 are now potentially in play,” wrote Deutsche Bank researchers, along with Jim Reid, head of thematic research. Concerns about Federal Reserve policy reverberated in financial markets on Monday, with U.S. stock indexes declining as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS economists raised their forecast for 2022 rate hikes, to four from three. Meanwhile, Treasury yields extended last week’s advance, which produced the biggest weekly gains in years, with the 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y rising around 3 basis points to 1.8% in Monday morning trading.There’s growing agreement among economists that the central bank has waited too long to tackle persistent inflation — hamstrung by a more flexible approach to price gains just as the COVID-19 pandemic was unleashing surprisingly sustainable upward pressures. Now, policy makers are attempting to navigate what some refer to as a “dual” tightening, by shrinking their balance sheet along with hiking their policy rate target from its current level between 0% and 0.25%. If Fed officials were to actually deliver rate hikes at each one of their seven meetings between March and year-end, that would be about twice as many rate increases as traders currently expect. Investors are awaiting Tuesday’s re-confirmation hearing of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Wednesday’s release of the consumer-price index report. That report is expected to show a 7.1% headline year-over year figure for December, which would be the highest level in four decades.

2022-01-11 19:05:00,"The Tell: Here are the ETFs to buy on persistently higher inflation in 2022 and beyond, says BlackRock’s head of iShares strategy","<p>Nic Antaya/APGiven an outlook for high U.S. inflation that’s likely to persist beyond 2022, Gargi Chaudhuri of BlackRock Inc., the world’s biggest asset manager, says investors should continue to hedge their portfolios with exchange-traded funds focused on inflation-linked bonds, commodities, infrastructure and real estate.Wednesday’s consumer-price report for December is likely to produce a headline year-over-year gain of more than 7%, the highest in almost 40 years, and to reflect a “broad-based” rise in inflation, Chaudhuri, head of iShares investment strategy for the Americas, wrote in a Tuesday note. Having a multiasset strategy is necessary in an environment in which inflation will probably settle above its pre-pandemic era levels “even after pandemic reopening effects have run their course.” The prospect of inflation that runs too hot for too long in the U.S. remained at the forefront on Tuesday, as lawmakers questioned the U.S. central bank’s ability to tackle price pressures during the confirmation hearing of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who has been nominated by President Joe Biden to serve a second term leading the institution.Investors took the testimony in stride, with Dow industrials DJIA, S&amp;P 500 SPX, and COMP all turning higher, though Treasury yields remained mixed.Sign up for our Market Watch Newsletters hereTraders foresee a total of three months of headline CPI readings that come in at or above 7%, including December’s, and don’t expect that measure to fall below 3% through November. Meanwhile, big names like JPMorgan Chase & Co’s JPM Jamie Dimon are expecting more than four rate increases from the Fed this year.“While we do not expect headline CPI inflation above 6% to persist over the medium term, we see room for inflation to settle at a higher level than the pre-pandemic era of sub-2% core inflation,” Chaudhuri wrote. “The continuation of powerful restart dynamics, more persistent supply chain challenges, strength in the all-important shelter inflation category of the CPI basket, and a savings-and wage-rich consumer will contribute to above-trend inflation.”She recommended that investors hedge by using ETFs managed by BlackRock such as: iShares 0-5 Year TIPS Bond ETF STIP; iShares TIPS Bond ETF TIP; iShares GSCI Commodity Dynamic Roll Strategy ETF COMT; iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF IFRA; and iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF IYR. Her recommendations are similar to those she gave in a December interview with Bloomberg TV, though at that time she said she expected inflation to moderate later in 2022.In Tuesday’s commentary, Chaudhuri also said she recommends stock investors “barbell their portfolio with value VLUE and quality factor oriented sectors QUAL of the market and focus on floating rate bonds FLOT in fixed income allocations.” She couldn’t immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.

Mollins said that while he believes Airbnb will prove the most resilient name in online travel for the foreseeable future, he expects the company's peers will see ""far greater"" gross book value (GBV) growth relative to pre-pandemic levels; many catalysts are either unlikely to come to fruition, such as increasing take rates on hosts and loyalty programs; and continued market pressure on growth names with inflation likely to persist in 2022. Mollins also sees an increased risk of ""material downward"" revenue revision in the first quarter as most of the omicron-related headwinds didn't emerge until the second half of December. The stock has dropped 4.8% over the past three months through Friday while the S&amp;P 500  has gained 3.9%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

A ""death cross"" appears when the 50-day moving average crosses (DMA) below the 200-DMA, which many chart watchers say marks the spot a short-term pullback graduates to a longer-term downtrend, but they're not always good market-timing tool given that their appearances are usually well telegraphed.

The COVID-19 vaccine provider's stock has plunged 31.6% during its losing streak, which is the longest since the biotechnology company went public in December 2018, and has plummeted 68.5% since its Aug. 9, 2021 post-pandemic peak of $484.47. The S&amp;P 500  has slipped 1.7% since Aug. 9. Papadakis raised his rating to hold, as the stock has more than halved in value since he started coverage of Moderna with a sell rating n Oct. 22, 2021, which resulted from a mixed financial update, ""somewhat underwhelming"" flu data and the expectation that the omicron variant will likely speed up the shift from pandemic to endemic, all at a time of rotation to value from growth in the broader stock market. He said that while he'll defer to stock market strategists on how long the rotation to value will continue, at current prices the stock valuation is ""more reasonable."" He trimmed his stock price target to $175 from $200, but the new target implies 14.7% upside from Tuesday's closing price of $152.54.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-01-26 17:42:31,UPDATE: At least 3 SPACs have withdrawn IPO plans in the last 24 hours amid highly volatile equity markets,"<p>At least four special-purpose acquisition corporations, or SPACs, have pulled their initial public offering plans in the past 24 hours, amid highly volatile equity markets. SPACs, also known as blank-check companies, are shell companies that raise money in an IPO and then acquire a business or businesses. The vehicle became popular during the pandemic, but many have struggled in the last year.  Do It Again Corp., a SPAC that was targeting a deal in the restaurant or food service sector, withdrew its registration early Wednesday. Murphy Canyon Acquisition Corp., which filed last June to raise $150 million in an IPO, withdrew its registration statement on Wednesday, and then said the withdrawal had been filed in error. Murphy Canyon had said it was seeking a target company in the real estate sector, ""including construction, homebuilding, real estate owners and operators, arrangers of financing, insurance, and other services for real estate, and adjacent businesses and technologies targeting the real estate space, which we may refer to as ""Proptech"" businesses."" Those moves came after CAVU Techology Acquisition Corp., which filed to raise up to $100 million in an IPO last March, also withdrew its registration statement. In its original filing, the company said it would target technology companies with an enterprise value of approximately $250 million to $500 million. Finally, TCG Growth Opportunities Corp., which filed for an IPO last March with plans to raise up to $250 million, also pulled its deal. The IPO market has gotten off to a weak start in 2022, with the Renaissance IPO ETF  down 24.6% in the year to date, while the S&amp;P 500  has fallen 9%. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-01-27 20:15:00,": Federal Reserve’s rate-hike plans may be exacerbating the risk of a U.S. economic slowdown in 2022, based on bond-market signals","<p>Olivier Douliery/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesJust as Federal Reserve policy makers gear up for a likely series of interest rate hikes starting in March, the Treasury market is warning that there may be limits around how far policy makers can go without triggering fears of an impending recession.A day after the Fed’s policy update, the widely followed spread between 2- and 10-year Treasury yields shrank to  the narrowest level since November 2020, while the counterpart gap between 5- and 30-years flattened to a level not seen since January 2019, according to Tradeweb data as of 2 p.m. Eastern time Thursday. Parts of the government bond market also moved closer to inversion — such as the gap between 7- and 10-year Treasury rates.While the likelihood of at least five rate hikes by year-end has risen to more than 50% as of Thursday, there’s a distinction between what the market expects the Fed to do and what the market thinks the Fed can do without harming economic growth.Yield spreads that fall below zero are typically seen as a harbinger of an economic downturn. The last time the 2s10s spread went negative was in 2019. Months later, the U.S. economy fell into a two-month downturn that lasted from February 2020 to April of that year, driven by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.“We’re not anywhere near a massive inversion, but to me the signal from the curve tends to be a very good indicator of where we are headed,” said Societe Generale’s Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy. “The flattening curve has to be a concern because it raises the question of just how much the Fed will be able to hike in order to bring down inflation, without signaling risks of a recession.”Both the 2s10s and 5s30s spreads have already fallen sharply this year, even before the Fed has delivered its first rate hike. One big factor influencing the trajectory of long-term rates, and thus the flattening of the curve, is demand for Treasurys from overseas investors and domestic asset liability managers, Rajappa said.Meanwhile, other corners of the Treasury market, such as the gap between 20-year and 30-year yields, remain inverted at a time when forecasters expect the economy to be slowing.  The median estimate of economists polled by the Wall Street Journal this month is for GDP growth to slow to 3.3% in 2022, down from more than 5% in 2021, and to continue slowing to 2.4% and 2.2% in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Economists at the American Bankers Association are also bracing for a U.S. slowdown over much of this year, while the International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for global growth in 2022, to 4.4% from a previously expected 4.9%. Read: Hidden in the GDP report is proof that the air is already coming out of the economyFor his part, Powell told reporters on Wednesday that many factors are influencing longer-term interest rates, and that the central bank does “monitor the slope of the yield curve, but we don’t control the slope of the yield curve.” “I don’t think of it as some kind of an iron law,” he said. “But we do look at it and try to understand the implications and what it’s telling us. And it’s one of many things that we monitor.”During Powell’s prepared remarks on Wednesday, the bond market began to price in higher inflation expectations, as reflected in the 10-year TIPS breakeven rate, on the view that the Fed would be adopting  “a more measured approach” to removing accommodation than previously thought, Rajappa said. But as Powell’s comments turned decidedly more hawkish during the question-and-answer session, the market walked back, leaving expectations at roughly where they were before Wednesday, she said.On Thursday, most Treasury yields turned lower, except for the 1- and 2-year rates BX:TMUBMUSD02Y, which rose by 15 and 12 basis points, respectively, to 0.73% and 1.19%. The 10- BX:TMUBMUSD10Y and 30-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD30Y each fell,  as major stock indexes were mixed.Sign up for our Market Watch Newsletters here</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The Treasury yield curve, for example, has flattened substantially since the start of the year — a warning that there may be limits to how far policy makers can go without triggering fears of an impending recession.  “Aggressive Fed tightening should affect the economy with a lag, weighing on 2023 growth,” Harris and the others wrote. They see the fed funds rate target ultimately ending up in a range between 2.75% and 3%, versus its current level of zero to 0.25%. The economists said they are making “wholesale revisions” to their economic and monetary policy outlook for 2022 and 2023, and that “an even faster-than-expected drop in unemployment and longer-than-expected supply disruptions mean more inflation.”Read:  U.S. inflation leaps 5.8% in 2021, PCE shows, and hits 40-year highTo be sure, BofA’s seven-rate-hike call for 2022 isn’t universally shared just yet. Fed funds futures are pointing to a more than 50% likelihood that the central bank will hike rates by 25 basis points at least five times this year, but the probability of seven hikes was only 6% as of Friday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.Harris couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.On Friday, most Treasury yields headed lower as U.S. consumer sentiment slumped to a decade low and inflation concerns mount.

Wallace IV on Monday downgraded shares of ConnectOne Bancorp  to outperform from strong buy and trimmed his price estimate by $2 to $38 a share following the company's fourth-quarter results. ""Assuming net interest margin has likely peaked, it will become a headwind as the Fed starts rising rates when the bulk of the industry anticipates margin tailwinds as we head into a rising rate environment,"" Wallace said. ""We anticipate investors may struggle to get comfortable investing aggressively in a bank that is facing pressure where most are experiencing tailwind."" On the plus side, ConnectOne's fee income could allow it to offset pressure on net interest margin, he said. Shares of ConnectOne fell 3% on Monday, compared to a rise of 0.7% by the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-01-31 20:46:00,The Fed: Fed’s Barkin says pace of coming rate hikes depends on pace of inflation,"<p>The pace of coming interest rate hikes will depend on the pace of inflation, said Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin on Monday. “I’d like us to be in a better position — somewhere closer to neutral certainly than we are now. And I think the pace of that just depends on inflation,” Barkin said, in an interview with CNBC. Barkin indicated he was not in a rush, saying the Fed has a “good part of the year” to get closer to neutral. Inflation on the cost of goods is likely to come down as supply chain bottlenecks ease, Barkin said. Consequently, it will be key to watch if wage pressures boost service sector inflation. “Obviously demand is going to play a big part of that,” he said.  Barkin dismissed concerns over the flattening of the yield curve. “There is just a lot of global money that trades at the longer-end of the yield curve,  BX:TMUBMUSD10Yand I have a hard time making much out of it, in that context,” he said.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Over the weekend, Bostic’s discussion of a half-point hike with the Financial Times garnered a lot of market attention. In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Bostic clarified that a half-point hike “is not my preferred setting of policy action at the next meeting.” Bostic said he expects three quarter-point rate hikes this year. The discussion about a more aggressive hike was meant to show that he is keeping his options open, he added. “I’m going to let the data and the evidence really guide us,” Bostic said. The Atlanta Fed president said he thought the Fed could start to shrink its balance sheet after the central bank has hiked rates a “few” times. “Let’s get a few of our interest rate moves in order to see how the economy is responding,” he said. Once the reduction has started, Bostic said he thought Fed could shrink its portfolio at a faster pace than in 2017-2019. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-02-01 11:37:55,European gas futures prices fall as Russia reportedly increases supplies,"<p>Natural gas prices tumbled on Tuesday, after Russia reportedly boosted supply flow through Ukraine. Natural gas on the Dutch-based TTF trading hub tumbled 10% to 75.85 euros a megawatt-hour. Rising prices over the past year have seen those futures climb nearly 200 euros a megawatt-hour, amid an energy crisis that has weighed on Europe in the past several months and which was not helped by tensions between the West and Russia over the latter's potential invasion of Ukraine. A March U.K. natural-gas prices contract  was down 11% to 180 pence a therm. The higher supplies came amid a reported resumption of normal levels for Russian deliveries into Slovakia at a point that borders Ukraine.

2022-02-01 21:54:00,"Market Extra: As Fed sets stage for March rate hike, stock-market investors face ‘perilous’ backdrop of higher volatility","<p>Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesInvestors, particularly those reliant on computer-generated decisions to buy or sell, face a treacherous backdrop of volatility driven by the Federal Reserve, following a brutal month of stock trading. January’s violent moves in equities offer a glimpse of what might still be in store: The S&amp;P 500SPX and Nasdaq CompositeCOMP indexes finished the month with their biggest percentage declines since March 2020, while the Dow Jones Industrial AverageDJIA staged an unprecedented 1,214-point reversal in a single day last week. Meanwhile, two- and five-year Treasurys, with rates reflecting the short- to intermediate-term path of Fed policy, are off to their worst start to a new year in more than three decades, according to Dow Jones Market Data. At issue is uncertainty over just how far the central bank is willing to go to tackle the highest U.S. inflation in almost 40 years, starting with a widely anticipated rate hike in March, investors and strategists say. That uncertainty is, ironically, giving way to at least one area of greater clarity: Big market swings are probably here to stay.“Volatility is probably the only thing that my compliance department would allow me to guarantee,” said John Lynch, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management, which oversees $175 billion in assets. “It could be 15 to 18 months until we get full clarity on the extent of Fed tightening, and the market is susceptible to further bouts until then.” Meanwhile, “investors need to be prepared for more equity-market volatility, and those caught up in quant or algorithmic trading may get hurt,” he said via phone Tuesday.Complicating the Fed’s task ahead is a pair of competing forces: One is the likelihood of no near-term letup in inflation, given signs of building price pressures from factors unrelated to U.S. labor and supply shortages. They include strong demand for merchandise and drought conditions outside the U.S. that are driving up the price of commodities like soybeans. The other force is worries about a potential economic slowdown — as flagged by the International Monetary Fund in January, and the Treasury market, which has flashed repeated warnings about the growth outlook since October. While many say higher inflation makes the case in favor of more aggressive Fed rate hikes, the prospect of a downturn supports the view that inflation could subside and policy makers need to be more cautious about tightening — which, together, are generating even more volatility for financial markets.The Fed will be “hard-pressed” to lift the fed-funds rate target to its long-run objective of 2.5%, from a current level between 0% and 0.25%, and is more likely to get no higher than 1.5% to 2%, according to Comerica’s Lynch. Despite growing expectations that the Fed could deliver a half-point hike in March, a nonfarm payrolls report that comes below expectations for February might be enough to remove that option, he said.Add to this environment a continuing debate about the degree to which shrinking the Fed’s nearly $9 trillion balance sheet will tighten financial conditions, or could act as a substitute for rate hikes–a process that some have dubbed as “dual tightening.” Read: What to expect from markets in the next six weeks, before the Federal Reserve revamps its easy-money stanceIn a BofA Global Research note Monday, strategists Andy Pham and Francisco Blanch, along with analyst Chintan Kotecha, wrote that “with risks tilted asymmetrically higher and all but confirmed by the Fed following the January meeting, we think quant investors should brace for a higher vol environment.” They said they see the backdrop as “perilous,” but say that “pockets of alpha can still be found across commodity and FX risk premia.”Quantitative systems have been used in recent years as a way to beat the market and post solid returns, while high-frequency trading algorithms have helped to make trading cheaper for many and account for a large portion of the buying and selling of U.S. shares that take place.U.S. stock benchmarks shook off a tentative start by late Tuesday, with the Dow industrials, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all posting gains. Meanwhile, Treasury yields were also higher, with the 10- BX:TMUBMUSD10Y and 30-year rates BX:TMUBMUSD30Y having their biggest advances in almost a week.“We’re going to see increased volatility among asset classes, and it’s very possible that quant investors would get hit hardest,” said Calvin Norris, portfolio manager and U.S. rates strategist at Aegon Asset Management in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which oversees $463.8 billion. “I do agree that it will be a long time before we alleviate a lot of the factors causing inflation, and there’s some reason to believe we’re going to see a tailwind from inflation for some time.”“The pace of Fed rate hikes and the pace of balance sheet runoff, we don’t know. So at this point, the market is left to its own imagination and can spin a hawkish or dovish story for itself,” he said via phone.   </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.
