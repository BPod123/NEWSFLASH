Separately, the company said long-time Chief Executive Joe Flanagan will step down from the role after almost 10 years with the company.

Excluding nonrecurring items, such as a $9.5 million increase in allowance for credit losses, FactSet said adjusted earnings per share of 8 cents missed the consensus estimate of 14 cents. The company disclosed that the increased allowance for credit losses was for a physician customer facing ""financial challenges"" that was unable to make a ""contractually required payment"" on Sept. 30.

Revenue for the latest quarter grew 30.6% to $496.0 million, but was below the FactSet consensus of $523.7 million.

The company said recent regulatory developments relating to its ovarian cancer drug Rubraca and challenges in raising fresh capital, ""a potential bankruptcy filing in the very near term looks increasingly probable as a way to preserve the value of our business and assets for the benefit of our stakeholders."" For now, the company is still evaluating its strategic options and discussing in and out of bankruptcy financing options with creditors, Clovis said in a regulatory filing. Rubraca is the company's sole product, but it faces steep competition from AstraZeneca   and Merck's  Lynparza and GSK's   Zejula, which are approved in the first-line maintenance ovarian cancer setting and have become the standard of care. Rubraca is approved as a second-line maintenance treatment for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who respond to chemo. That is a smaller and shrinking patient pool, given the competition from Lynparza and Zejula. The Food and Drug Administration has told Clovis it requires more mature patient survival data from its late-stage trial dubbed Athena-Mono and said it would closely scrutinize its application for approval. Clovis had a net loss of $56 million in the third quarter, narrower than the $67.4 million loss posted in the year-earlier period.

""In what has been a dark comedy show with Twitter, Musk has essentially tarnished the Tesla story/stock and is starting to potentially impact the Tesla brand with this ongoing Twitter train wreck disaster,"" Ives wrote in a note to clients. ""From selling Tesla stock again and again, to the PR nightmare that Twitter has become, cutting 50% of employees and then needing to bring some back, Musk's attention focus from Tesla to Twitter, and ultimately the fear that this Twitter lightening rod of controversy on a daily (almost hourly) basis starts to negatively change the Tesla brand globally."" Tesla IS Musk, Ives wrote, and it has made him the richest man in the world. Tesla is the golden child of his empire, and he's changed the auto world much in the way that Apple's  iPhone changed phones. But now he has managed to do what short sellers tried and failed -- to crush Tesla's stock despite the EV company being in a position of strength. Ives said he still believes in the EV story as a longer-term play, but Tesla's roughly 25% selloff since the Twitter deal is ""an agonizing cycle for investors to navigate and has put massive pressure on the stock as its a Boy Who Cried Wolf narrative shaping up."" Ives is sticking with his outperform rating on Tesla stock but lowered his price target to $250 from $300 to reflect the overhang.

2022-11-16 21:29:00,"Market Extra: More trouble is brewing in the $24 trillion Treasury market: This time, it’s about central clearing","<p>Stefani Reynolds/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesEfforts to reduce risks within the nearly $24 trillion U.S. Treasury market, the world’s deepest and most liquid securities market, are ironically creating angst among market players. The anxiety is centered on the concept of central clearing,  a method used to reduce and manage risks in financial markets. In September, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rules that would mandate the central clearing of a large swath of Treasury transactions. Only a small percentage of such transactions have centrally cleared in recent years.The biggest concern about central clearing is the cost of participating in it, according to a panel discussion at the 2022 U.S. Treasury Market Conference held at the New York Fed on Wednesday. Though panel participants generally agreed that the efforts would help to improve the Treasury market’s resiliency, they said that some players might not be able to absorb the additional costs and that it’s not clear how well the central-clearing system would work during periods of turmoil. “The cost of transacting in the Treasury market is going to go up and, as dealers, we are concerned about that,” said Kavi Gupta, co-head of global rates trading and counterparty portfolio management for BofA Securities. Though larger players may adapt, smaller ones may not and the topic is “something our clients actively talk about.” Concerns about  liquidity in the Treasury market have been brewing for months, particularly as the Federal Reserve’s quantitative tightening process kicked into high gear. In October, BofA Securities warned that the “fragile” market was at risk of “large scale forced selling” or a surprise that might lead to a breakdown. And earlier this month, the Fed confirmed fears about low liquidity in what has historically been one of the financial system’s most stable corners.Liquidity refers to the ease with which securities can be bought and sold, and a lack of it means that Treasurys can’t be transacted smoothly without significantly impacting the underlying prices on government debt. Exacerbating liquidity woes is the departure of big, regular buyers and the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes to combat inflation, which have generally encouraged investors to sell off bonds this year. If the cost of transacting Treasurys becomes prohibitive for smaller dealers, then the question becomes “are you indirectly reducing liquidity” for the market, said panel participant Lynn Paschen, a senior portfolio manager at Schwab Asset Management. “That would be my main concern.” In addition, some funds are required to invest in Treasurys and additional costs may need to be passed on to shareholders, she said.Gerald Pucci, Jr.,  managing director and global head of repo at BlackRock BLK, said he worries about rising costs for the firm’s pension- fund clients. “I would think any kind of central clearing, on the margin, is a positive,” but if undertaken too quickly “could be problematic.”Most Treasury yields slipped on Wednesday, despite strong October retail-sales data. The 10-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD10Y fell below 3.7%, sending a popular bond-market gauge of impending recessions to the most negative level in more than 40 years. Earlier on Wednesday, New York Fed President John Williams told conference participants that the Treasury market’s liquidity problems have the potential to interfere with the central bank’s ability to transmit monetary policy to the economy. Meanwhile, Nellie Liang, undersecretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department, said that the UST market needs to be monitored for vulnerabilities, given the risks of a potential shock.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

He also said that price stability is a “must-have” for the central bank and that the Treasury market “is at the center of it all,” so the “time is now” to find ways to strengthen core parts of financial system. “If the Treasury market isn’t functioning well, it can impede the transmission of monetary policy to the economy,” he said. The almost $24 trillion Treasury market is the world’s deepest and most liquid securities market, and provides the benchmark levels at which interest rates are set across the U.S. economy. By hiking interest rates aggressively to arrest inflation, policy makers are trying to tighten financial conditions and slow the economy down. See also: More trouble is brewing in the $24 trillion Treasury market: This time, it’s about central clearingLiquidity concerns have plagued the market for months, and the Fed confirmed those fears earlier this month in its financial stability report. The remarks by Williams came as one of the  bond market’s most popular recession gauges shrank to its most negative level in more than 40 years on Wednesday, in a worrisome sign about the outlook. The inversion was driven primarily by a steep drop in the 10-year yield, BX:TMUBMUSD10Y which fell 10.5 basis points to 3.693%.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The divergence in stock moves appears to be primarily because while both are broadline retailers, they are actually part of very different sectors. As Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Astrachan noted, more than half of Walmart's sales are from the grocery category, which is why the company is labeled a consumer staple, which is considered defensive during economic slowdowns as it sells what consumer's need over what they want. But with only about one-fifth of Target's sales in the grocery category, Target is considered a consumer discretionary, which is more susceptible to economic slowdowns.

Qatar is the first country in the Arab World to host the World Cup, although the tournament has been mired in controversy.

Within minutes Ecuador forward Valencia had the ball in the back of the net following a mistake by Qatar goalkeeper Saad Al Sheeb, but the goal was ruled out by the Video Assistant Referee. It was a nervy start from Qatar on their World Cup debut and Ecuador continued to press, with Valencia winning a penalty after a quarter of an hour when he was fouled by Al Sheeb. The striker duly sent the Qatar keeper the wrong way for the tournament’s opening goal. Valencia doubled Ecuador’s lead on 31 minutes with an emphatic header into the bottom corner from Angelo Preciado’s cross.

As the soccer showpiece began, Ecuador thought they had opened the scoring through Enner Valencia just minutes after kickoff, only for the goal to be ruled out for offside after a check by the Video Assistant Referee. Ecuador took the lead after 16 minutes when Valencia converted a penalty to score the first goal of the World Cup.</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose about 200 points, or 0.6%, ending near 33,747 Friday. The S&amp;P 500 index  closed up 0.5%, but failed to end above the 4,000 mark after trading above that level several times intraday in past sessions this week. The Nasdaq Composite Index  eked out a 0.01% gain Friday. Stocks wobbled earlier this week after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said the central bank's rate could end up as high as 7%, up from the current 3.75% to 4% range. Higher rates make it more expensive for households and businesses to borrow. This tightening cycle differs from the recent past in that the central bank has been raising rates into what appears to be a slowing economy, with economists and investors seeing the risks of recession increasing as the Fed tightens the screws of financing conditions. The Dow ended the week flat, while the S&amp;P 500 posted a 0.7% weekly decline and the Nasdaq shed 1.6%, according to FactSet. Stocks have ended lower in two of the past three weeks.

In May, BNY Mellon Investment Advisor paid a $1.5 million penalty to the SEC after the agency claimed there were misstatements and omissions concerning its ESG considerations.
