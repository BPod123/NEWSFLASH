Black Knight said the slowdown to 17.3% annual home price growth in June from 19.3% was broad based was a record by far, ""and it wasn't even close,"" said Black Knight Data & Analytics President Ben Graboske; in comparison, the strongest single-month slowing during the 2006 housing downturn was 1.19 percentage points. The slowdown comes along with a 22% increase in the number of homes listed for sale the past two months, which was the biggest inventory gain in 12 years. The company said the ""clear driver"" of the inventory gains is a decline in sales activity, resulting from the lowest levels of home affordability in nearly 40 years due to rising interest rates. </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-08-02 11:02:00,Arconic tops Q2 estimates but stock falls on soft guidance,"<p>Arconic Corp.  said Tuesday it had net income of $114 million, or $1.05 a share, in the second quarter, after a loss of $427 million, or $3.89 a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales climbed 41% to $2.5 billion. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of 73 cents and sales of $2.4 billion. The maker of aluminum for cars and airplanes said sales were boosted by the ramp up of packaging sales in the U.S., growth in ground transportation and building and construction sales, a recovery in aerospace, and aluminum prices. The company is tweaking its full-year guidance to reflect falling aluminum prices and their impact on revenue and working capital. It now expects revenue to range from $9.6 billion to $10.0 billion, compared with previous guidance of $10.1 billion to $10.5 billion. The forecast is based on expectations for LME aluminum prices of $2,500/mt and Midwest Premium of $700/mt, reduced from prior assumptions for LME of $3,350/mt and Midwest Premium of $850/mt when the company announced first-quarter earnings. Arconic also said it is pausing plans to sell its Kawneer business, a deal it had mooted in early June, because of the current uncertainty in the debt markets. ""Kawneer is a very valuable business and the Company does not believe it would receive proper value for it under current economic and market conditions,"" Arconic said in a statement.

2022-08-02 20:04:00,Market Extra: Why China-Taiwan tensions moved to the forefront of financial market worries,"<p>Sam Yeh/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesIt’s an island off the coast of China, with a land area comparable to Maryland and Delaware combined. Its population is about 1 million higher than that of Florida.Often overlooked in world headlines, Taiwan grabbed the financial market’s attention as the biggest macro risk of the day, prompting many traders and investors to turn briefly away from concerns about recession, inflation, central banks and Russia’s war on Ukraine. The focus was on U.S. Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, which triggered fears of retaliation by the island’s giant neighbor China. Earlier on Tuesday, global stocks sold off on the geopolitical tension, while investors scrambled to the safety of U.S. Treasurys and traders took a second look at their positions across assets. After Pelosi’s plane landed safely in Taipei, Taiwan’s capital, market sentiment seemed to improve in the stock market, with the S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq Composite temporarily popping higher.“Macro investors have been counting on China’s reopening to stabilize positions,” said Jim Vogel, a Memphis-based executive vice president and interest-rate strategist at FHN Financial. They’ve pared allocations to equities and have been counting on floors for commodity prices, as well as limits to downside price action in fixed income. Now, however, relying on China “as an international growth driver is unreliable,” Vogel wrote in a note Tuesday. What’s more, China’s intentions toward Taiwan “have been obvious and threatening for years,” and the narrative between the two “will not go away for years.”  Pelosi is the highest-ranking American politician to visit the island of Taiwan in 25 years, when then-Speaker Newt Gingrich arrived in 1997. On Tuesday, jitters first emerged in Asian markets, which were “shaky” in the morning amid fears that China’s military jets “could buzz Pelosi’s plane,” said Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist for AGF Investments. Valliere described the potential for a mistake by either side as “quite serious.”Chinese President Xi Jinping is seen by intelligence experts as needing a “diversion” from his country’s struggling economy and attempts to recover from “exceptionally harsh” COVID restrictions, according to Valliere. At the same time, China’s president “cannot afford to look weak” as he seeks a third term in office later this year. Meanwhile, Beijing sees Taiwan as a threat, given the island’s healthy economy and personal freedoms. Taiwan is generally regarded as the most democratic place in East Asia. Pelosi’s visit will have a “major” impact — resulting in further deterioration of relations between the U.S. and China, “with little hope for a reconciliation on trade,” the AGF strategist said.Frantic traders had been tracking every move of Pelosi’s plane on popular flight trackers, and it was flight-to-safety sentiment that drove bond yields lower earlier on Tuesday, according to Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors in New York. He described the bond market’s moves as being the result of “the Nancy Pelosi kerfuffle.”According to senior analyst Neil Thomas and others at Eurasia Group, a New York-based consulting firm, “Pelosi’s visit will significantly raise U.S.-China tensions but is unlikely to produce a Chinese reaction that risks conflict.”Eurasia Group sees “a 25% chance of a major security crisis, such as a prolonged U.S.-China military standoff that threatens further escalation,” they wrote in a note. Still, Beijing could order additional military air and naval exercises,  might sanction the U.S. delegation and freeze bilateral exchanges, and has the potential to consider boycotts and sanctions on Taiwan and U.S. firms, the consultancy said.On Tuesday, all three major U.S. stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP finished lower. Meanwhile, investors sold off government bonds, sending yields higher across the board in a reversal of Tuesday’s earlier bond rally.     </p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

2022-08-02 18:36:00,"The Tell: Financial markets may see three-month string of 8.8%  inflation readings starting next week, adding up to `bad news’","<p>Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesThe financial market’s most knowledgeable inflation traders are expecting a string of roughly 8.8% annual headline U.S. consumer-price readings over the next three months, starting with the Aug. 10 release of July’s data.While such readings would be below June’s 9.1% reading and support the theory that inflation may have peaked at an almost 41-year high, the expectations of inflation-derivatives traders still adds up to what could be a lot of bad news for the broader market. The reason boils down to the length of time that high U.S. inflation persists, which would upend the hopes of investors, traders and policy makers for a relatively quicker and meaningful slowdown in price gains.Read:‘Peak inflation’ trade is driving financial markets as investors brace for U.S. economic slowdownThe string of 8.8% figures — broken down as 8.78% for July, 8.75% for August and 8.79% for September — already takes into account the recent decline in gas prices  — along with a drop in commodities, such as wheat W00 — and would come while the Federal Reserve is in the midst of an aggressive rate-hike campaign. Hopes that inflation may have peaked in June may be obscuring the risk that a wage-price spiral could still develop and that price gains in other areas, like shelter, could accelerate or remain sticky, some say.“It’s bad news to have inflation last so high for so long,” said Derek Tang, an economist at Monetary Policy Analytics in Washington.  “The longer high inflation lasts, the more worried Fed officials get that inflation expectations are getting unanchored, and they can’t allow that.” While much still depends on labor-market data and whether a wage-price spiral unfolds, “people are going to price in a higher fed funds rate for the end of year and rate hikes lasting longer into 2023, with the first rate cut not happening until later,” Tang said via phone on Tuesday. Three annual headline CPI prints of essentially 9% “make it hard to see how the Fed is going to start cutting rates in 2023. Inflation that starts to come down is good, but the question is, ‘Does it come down soon enough?’ ” The Fed has a window to prove it’s going to bring inflation down, and people are going to start losing faith in that story.”For the time being, financial markets appear to be broadly accepting the idea that the central bank will more or less get a handle on inflation in the long run: Five-, 10- and 30-year breakeven rates remain contained within a range of 2.2% to 2.7%, while yields on Treasury inflation-protected securities are off their multi-year highs but moving up on Tuesday, according to Tradeweb data. In addition, all three major U.S. stock indexes DJIASPXCOMP are off the lows they reached in June, when inflation fears dominated. After a jump in growth and technology-related stocks in July, there’s now a question over how recessionary risks will weigh on their recent bear-market rally. Ed Perks of Franklin Templeton Investment Solutions said in a phone interview late last week that the market may be looking through “rose-colored glasses.” “We still have pretty tough sledding ahead of us,” he added. On Tuesday, major stock indexes were lower in afternoon trading as investors also factored in geopolitical risks between the U.S. and China. Meanwhile, Treasury yields were broadly higher as investors sold off government debt, reversing course from earlier in the day. “If we are going to get a labor/price shock, equities might be affected very heavily,” Tang of Monetary Policy Analytics told MarketWatch. Soaring labor costs heading into economic weakness “is going to hit revenues and could be an issue for profit margins.” “The bigger issue is that the market may be misunderstanding how serious the Fed is about inflation,” he said. “It may be wishful thinking to think the Fed can bring it back down to 2%.” On Tuesday,  two top officials at the Fed said the central bank needs to raise interest rates a lot higher and probably keep them high for awhile to contain the worst outbreak of inflation in almost 41 years.Read:Top Fed officials say U.S. interest rates to keep rising until high inflation eases</p><p>Market Pulse Stories are Rapid-fire, short news bursts on stocks and markets as they move.

Discovery  were falling more than 10% in premarket trading Friday after the media giant fell way short of revenue expectations and posted a sizable loss.
