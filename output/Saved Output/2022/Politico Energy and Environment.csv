2022-12-13 17:10:22,Granholm announces fusion technology 'breakthrough',
2022-12-13 15:36:05,‘America has achieved a tremendous scientific breakthrough’,"Fusion energy has long been a dream for scientists who say the technology will enable cheap, plentiful power that does not produce the planet-heating gases or pollution that come with burning fossil fuels."
2022-12-13 14:46:35,What to know about DOE’s fusion ‘breakthrough’,"Experiments at a U.S. government lab may have provided ""proof that the physics work."" But future fusion reactors might turn to a different technology for replicating the energy that powers the sun."
2022-12-13 00:07:37,‘It’s one of the biggest results of science in the past 20-30 years’,"But turning the newest breakthrough at a U.S. Energy Department lab into abundant, carbon-free power may require hundreds of billions of dollars. And many technical hurdles await."
