However, modern racial movements and policies, he says, have done more harm than good for the cause of equality. Increasing dependence on the government has undermined the cause of liberty. Steele, along with his son Eli, have recently released a new documentary, “What Killed Michael Brown?”, an investigation into the 2014 Ferguson, Missouri shooting, just as George Floyd’s death rocked the nation. The film has been labeled as controversial in some unexpected ways. Shelby joined the show today to share the full story, as well as discuss the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and organization, and the reason President Trump and his supporters are so often labeled as racist. "

The author, J.D. Vance, wrote about his upbringing in the Appalachian regions of Kentucky and Middletown, Ohio. A look into the history and values in this area of the country, it was recommended by mainstream outlets and cultural leaders in mass for insight into the plights of the white working class that impacted the 2016 election. That praise was short lived, however, when the nearly unanimous edict came down from the media that the trials of impoverished white Americans were insignificant and should be ignored.
