Could Portugal's approach help the U-S fight its opioid epidemic?<br /><br />For sponsor-free episodes of <em>Consider This</em>, sign up for <em>Consider This+</em> via Apple Podcasts or at <a href=""http://plus.npr.org/"">plus.npr.org</a>.  <br /><br />Email us at <a href=""mailto:considerthis@npr.org""><em>considerthis@npr.org</em></a><em>."
